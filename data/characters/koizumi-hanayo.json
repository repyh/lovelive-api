    "personality": "Hanayo is a very shy, quiet character who doesn't normally voice her opinions. She is very reserved and will often let other people make decisions for her because of this. Hanayo is also easily scared. However, her personality changes when it comes to school idols, as she is very enthusiastic about them. She doesn't usually state her desires either, so when she wanted to become an idol she didn't say so for a while and needed a push from Maki and Rin to become one. Despite her timid nature, she is quite kind-hearted and considerate to her friends feelings, similar to Kotori Minami.\nHanayo loves to eat anything, especially rice balls. For that reason, she usually gets upset with her weight, as shown in Season 2 Episode 7.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "Hanayo is interested in drawing and origami and is obsessed with school idols. She is a caretaker for the school's alpacas, and became the Idol Research Club's president after the third-years graduated.",
