    "personality": "Kotori is known for having her head in the clouds. Despite this, she is μ's designer along with Nico Yazawa. Kotori has a very huge aptitude for fashion and is very good at drawing costumes for the group. Kotori is shown to be very kind and supportive to her friends and genuinely cares about them, especially their feelings: she's the most altruistic character in her group, and cares more how others feel than how she does herself. However, this can go too far as Kotori usually backs Honoka up when she (Honoka) is scolded by Umi.\nKotori is also shown as the most indecisive person among all nine members and tends to have Umi Sonoda and Honoka Kosaka, her childhood friends, make decisions for her. She also has a hard time expressing her feelings, since she always takes other people's feelings into consideration. Kotori is a kind person, but she can also be gullible, as shown in Season 1 Episode 10, wherein Nico claimed that she has a personal chef like Maki Nishikino, and Kotori fell for Nico's lie unknowingly.\nIn Kotori's Holiday (July 2012), it is revealed that Kotori is the type of person who can't relax unless all the work is done as soon as possible.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "She is μ's' wardrobe supervisor and their choreographer before Eli Ayase takes over the role.[2] It is discovered in Season 1 Episode 9 that Kotori worked in a maid café in Akihabara and is a famous maid named \"Minalinsky\". She was known as a \"Legendary Maid\" in Akihabara due to her kindness, cuteness, and soft voice. She also likes making candy. Her special skill is her flexibility; her legs can reach her shoulders. She later becomes part of the student council and assists Honoka and Umi in doing their student-council duties.",
