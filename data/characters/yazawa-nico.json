    "personality": "Normally, Nico has quite an abrasive personality, but when she takes on her alternate personality, she becomes a happy, upbeat character who is always smiling, often saying her catchphrase, \"Nico Nico Nii!\" (にっこにっこにー), accompanied with a pose. She usually thinks a bit highly of herself but, despite that, she is also caring.\nIt is later revealed in Season 2 Episode 4 that her obsession with performative, over-the-top happiness and cuteness is because of the difficulty of her home situation. Her family circumstances and the role she plays in it have led her to fixate on both making sure as many people as possible are smiling and also seeking and receiving attention and praise. This manifests in her idol obsession and subsequent persona.\nA common joke in the series is that she's often ignored by the other members of μ's when she claims that she is the better idol. An example of her trying to make the others believe she is the better idol is in Season 1 Episode 10 when Nico claims that she has a personal chef like Maki and has never cooked before. Kotori falls for the lie unknowingly. However, she accidentally forgot about her lie when it was dinner time, and ended up cooking for everyone to reveal the truth.\nSometimes, her determination to become the best idol causes her to be a bit cold, calculating, and sometimes even evil in her intentions. An example of this is in Season 1 Episode 6 where she is seen suggesting that the girls hold a karaoke and dancing competition, hoping to outshine the others, so that everyone will accept that she is the better idol and to be able to claim centre position.\nNico often gets annoyed with the former student council president, Eli Ayase, for taking away the spotlight from her with her beauty and maturity.\nShe also argues a lot with Maki, since their personalities often clash together. However, they have a good friendship and they actually care about each other.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "Nico was the Idol Research Club's president (before she passed on the role to Hanayo) and is interested in fashion. Therefore, she designs the group's outfits with Kotori. Her special skill is hair arrangement.\nIn Season 1 Episode 10, Nico is shown to be a very skilled cook despite saying she has never cooked before.",
