    "personality": "Honoka is an optimist who is never afraid to take risks. She is always in a good mood and likes to look at the bright side of things. She is determined and once her mind is set on something, nothing can stop her. This is believed to be the driving force behind μ's formation and success. But because of her persistent personality, she often overexerts herself.\nHer personality is similar to Rin Hoshizora's because they are both determined and hard-working. For example, in Season 1 Episode 7, Honoka, Rin and Nico Yazawa had to work hard to pass exams in order to enter Love Live!, and are known as the 'Three Idiots'.\nShe likes to eat bread, but she does not enjoy eating red bean or white bean paste despite working at her family's Japanese sweets shop.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "Honoka enjoys swimming and collecting stickers. Her special skill is often finding money on the streets, which she attributes to good luck. She is also the leader of the school idol group μ's. Starting from the second season, she succeeds Eli Ayase as Otonokizaka High School's student council president.\nIn the manga version, before starting an idol club, Honoka is in the Kendo club with Umi and is good enough to win a tournament.",
