    "personality": "Maki has the qualities of a tsundere, and she has a hard time admitting her true feelings to her peers. She also has somewhat childish beliefs which are undoubtedly reflections on her somewhat sheltered upbringing. One such example is her uninterrupted belief in Santa Claus, which the rest of the group finds out about while together. Maki continues on to describe (somewhat proudly) how she cleans the chimney for Santa, and how he never misses her house. Nico attempts to disillusion her, but is held back by other members who did not want to ruin Maki's belief.\nMaki was initially portrayed as a loner in the first few episodes, and spent her time alone in the music room. Her standoffishness can be attributed to her tsundere qualities in which although she may want to get close to others, she cannot admit that and refuses, as best she can, to show it. Throughout the series, Maki opens up more and more, but elements of her solitude life before µ's crop up from time to time with her awkwardness and inability to properly admit her investment in their friendship.\nMaki is also quite stubborn. This was shown when she was invited to play at the beach, as she was withdrawn from the group and not interested in playing with them.\nAlthough Maki is not conceited nor-stuck up, there are moments where her pride combined with her privileged and sheltered upbringing with few other friends lead Maki to unintentionally act insensitively or arrogantly. Despite this, µ's understands that Maki has no such intentions, and usually any questionable interaction with Maki is usually because of her tsundere side preventing her from speaking how she really feels.\nHer personality often clashes with Nico Yazawa, such as when she called Nico stubborn during Season 2 Episode 4. Rin, however, tells her \"You're one to talk\", implying that Maki is stubborn as well.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "Maki is skilled at playing the piano, and is the composer and vocal coach of µ's. Her other hobbies are photography and stargazing. Her special skill is achieving full marks on tests. She also became the Idol Research Club's vice president after the third-years graduated.",
