    "personality": "Rin appears to be a bit of a tomboy, though with a girly streak. She likes sports and is arguably the most athletic member of μ's, on par with Eli. Like Honoka, Rin is very energetic, hard-working and active; her hard-working personality is notably displayed in Season 1 Episode 7, where she, Honoka, and Nico had to work hard to pass exams in order to enter the Love Live! tournament. Together, the three are known as the \"san baka (三馬鹿 lit. Three idiots)\". One key difference between her and Honoka, however, is that Rin is known for being very mindful of other people's opinions, as she puts their feelings first before taking action into something. This is shown multiple times throughout the anime.\nPart of Rin's tomboyish personality stems from the fact she was teased by her classmates for wearing skirts and dresses in public, to the point she stopped wearing them as often, and wore shorts or pants instead. This insecurity later grew into a complex as time passed, to the point she no longer wore skirts or dresses, other than for her uniform or her idol outfits. This is also further compounded by her petite body shape. With the help of her friends, on Season 2 Episode 5, Rin is able to get over this complex due to being the center of a live performance where she has to wear a dress, and she is fully able of embracing her feminine side, wearing skirts once again.\nRin has a very mischievous side, and likes to playfully tease her best friend Hanayo. She also likes hugs, and has attempted to hug every member of μ's. As stated above, she enjoys acting like a cat, complete with a curved mouth reminiscent of one, which also translates to her energetic and mischievous self.",
    "clubs-hobbies": "Rin is great at many different kind of sports. She enjoys dancing and is the current practice leader of μ's. A special skill of her is her very sharp nose, able to smell things with little effort.",
