  "description": "μ's (pronounced \"Muse\") was a school idol group formed and led by Honoka Kosaka in Love Live!. They were the school idol group of Otonokizaka High School. The group consisted of nine members and was initially formed with the purpose of bringing attention to the school as it was to be shut down due to a lack of future enrolling students. The group disbanded in the anime after the 3rd years graduated, staying true to their status as school idols, unlike their rival A-RISE, which choose to stay as an idol group even after school. In other words, μ's no longer exist as an idol group. However, they did make their final appearance in the movie.",
