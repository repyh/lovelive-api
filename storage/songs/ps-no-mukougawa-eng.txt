At a table in an empty cafe
I rest my chin in my hand and think
What are you doing now?
Who are you spending your time with?

I take out
The postcard I bought earlier
I try writing "How are you?"
But I can't find the right words to follow

We talk (oh yeah)
Everyday, but it's just not enough!

You're so far from me now, and with these lonely feelings
I'm drinking my black tea that's already gotten cold
But one day, yes, one day
I feel as though we'll meet again, so
I won't let myself feel down!

My handwriting feels so awkward
As I looked over the little letters
It just gets worse and worse
Then my ballpoint pen spun

And flew out of my hand (oh no!)
"How could that have happened?"
I said, laughing

I'll put down a few final words
Like an extra, (a P.S.)
Thank you very much
Because one day, yes, one day
I know we'll meet again
I'm waiting for that day

I don't need a reply
But what a fun a season that was (I need you)
Thinking back on it
My chest tightens
And hurts a little

You're so far from me now, and with these lonely feelings
I'm drinking my black tea that's already gotten cold
But one day, yes, one day
I feel as though we'll meet again
It's all because of you, isn't it?
I'll put down a few final words
Like an extra, (a P.S.)
Thank you very much
Because one day, yes, one day
I know we'll meet again
I'm waiting for that day
But it's okay to write you a postcard, right?

Thank you!
