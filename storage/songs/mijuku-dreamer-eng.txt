Even if we're always together
Our hearts lose their way when we can't explain our feelings
So let's forget our tears
And sing together

Words are not enough
As there aren't enough words to do it justice - that's why we fail to connect
But I hated the fact
That we drifted apart, it's always been on my mind

I can't stop feeling
That I want you to understand, I'm sure I've hurt you in the process
But I won't bother
Trying to hide this selfishness now as I just can't let go

So let's combine our strength and swim through the sea of dreams
This sea before us today...!

Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I bet it will be fun
If we're all together, I'm sure we can overcome it
As everything starts now, so let's do our best together
Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I really want to make it fun
When we're all together, I start wanting to push myself
As I want to keep growing as I'm a young DREAMER

It seems we'll finally be able to join as one
So let's start by expressing ourselves freely
'Cause I believe there's a new light to be found there


Together just like this, let's swim through the sea of dreams
This sea before us today...!

When the storm comes, let's play until it clears up
I'm sure it'll be fun if we sing
You're not alone so you'll be able to overcome it
Strangely enough, my fear has disappeared
When the storm comes, let's play until it clears up
I really look forward to that too
You're not alone so don't push yourself
It's good to help each other out as we're all excited young DREAMERS

Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I bet it will be fun
If we're all together, I'm sure we can overcome it
As everything starts now, so let's do our best together
Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I really want to make it fun
When we're all together, I start wanting to push myself
As I want to keep growing as I'm a young DREAMER
