We steadily go outside and search for something else
When you try something out, you’ll often find unexpected happiness

No matter the worries or the ridicules
We won’t lose, we won't be discouraged, even though we might cry a little
But it’s alright, because tomorrow will come soon

Rather than words speaking of our dreams, let’s put them into song
Because if we do that, we’ll be able to put our feelings right now into words
A song speaking of our dreams will be born from our words
These feelings that are spreading
Are links to the melodies that we love
It’s time to stop running and move forward to a new place

Singing my song for my dream!
Singing my song for my dream!

Something will definitely begin; Everyone’s energy is making noises
We will try something out, and our feelings will come tightly together

We want to feel it and get more excited
The things that you wish for, I wished for too. Our hearts are getting closer
Isn’t that good?

The words of the future we wish for will become a song of that future
That is the extent of the passion in our hearts that wants to fly out
Our song flows out from our words of the future we wish for
Don’t stop, we'll go far
On a journey with the melodies that we love
So let’s have fun no matter where we go; It’s a new season

Yes, that’s right, we can’t decide that fast
But see, somehow our bodies are breaking out into a dance,
Joining up with the melodies we love. Come... come!

Rather than words speaking of our dreams, let’s put them into song
Because if we do that, we’ll be able to put our feelings right now into words
A song speaking of our dreams will be born from our words
These feelings that are spreading
Are links to the melodies that we love
It’s time to stop running and move forward to a new place.

Singing my song for my dream!
Singing my song for my dream!
