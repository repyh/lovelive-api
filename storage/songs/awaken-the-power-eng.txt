When I start I never really think about
How it'll end or anything like that
It seems like it'll go on forever, so I only look ahead
Since that's how I've been running until now
Where, where where shall I go next?

Come on! Awaken the power, yeah!
Are you ready? Let's go!!

Even though I'm supposed to know a lot of words
At times like this, they won't come out
My heart is filled with these strong emotions
And I feel like I'll cry before I can say anything

Once I've decided to do my best (I definitely won't lose)
I've always worked hard with everyone (I definitely won't lose)
I won't know that I can't do it until I try
What's awakening inside of me is a new power
My power, new power, yeah!

I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
So I'll keep on dreaming forever
I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
What I'll choose depends on me
Wake up my new power
The power sleeping within me starts to move
Start up now don't just stand there, let's go!
Where, where, where shall I go?

Even when I'm happy, my tears flow
And erase my pain (washes them away)
The things I worried about before, I feel
Are now completely gone - I've really grown
Fighting fighting!
Fighting fighting!

Didn't we decide to do our best (I definitely won't lose)
We worked at it together (I definitely won't lose)
If we can't do something, we'll challenge it over and over
From failure to success, I want to change the future
My power new power
Fighting fighting! New power! Yeah!

I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
So I'll keep on dreaming forever
I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
What I'll choose depends on me
Wake up my new power
The power sleeping within me starts to move
Start up now don't just stand there, let's go!
Where, where, where shall I go?

My power new power in the depths of my heart
My power new power looking for a new world
Wake up wake up my new world
