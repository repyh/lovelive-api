Maze! I can't escape from it
A maze! Is what the world has become
Ah! It might be on the verge of collapse
So I want you to be determined
Don't let me down

This map is nonsense
This sky is a mysterious color
Even so, because you are here
I don't think the future is going to be this dark
I believe you'll show me
A new landscape

I'm taking this plane to the wilderness
Is this going to be our last flight?
But I won't give up, that's what I decided
That's why we should go together

What I want to protect is
Dream! The world I saw in my dreams
Dream! One in which we can speak of the future with smiles
Start! Your preparations
Start! If you're ready, let's hurry
Ah, let's search for what we must do
I want us to live as best as we can
Don't stop my mind

No matter how much we land and take off
Flashing thunder is always right on our tail
Somehow I'm feeling something beyond anxiety

The propellers of courage rotate
No matter if it's a dangerous journey
I want to keep moving onward even in this chaotic sky
Let's go together forever

In this era of changes
Dream! While you're dreaming
Dream! Nightmares is what you get if you don't move on
Maze! I can't escape from it
A maze! Is what the world has become
Ah! It might be on the verge of collapse
So I want you to be determined
Don't let me down

I've chosen to become stronger
Even if it means travelling alone, but
If I'm at your side...it would be amazing!

What I want to protect is
Dream! The world I saw in my dreams
Dream! One in which we can speak of the future with smiles
Start! Your preparations
Start! If you're ready, let's hurry
Ah, let's search for what we must do
I want us to live as best as we can
Don't stop my mind
