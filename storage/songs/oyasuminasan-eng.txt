As if it's nothing special,
We laugh next to each other everyday
But lately I think I understand a little
That it's something pretty difficult

When I came to know sadness
That I can't put into words
Frustrated at my powerlessness
My tears plip-plopped down

But, when I think with a smile
About the things to look forward to tomorrow
The sky in my heart clears
Ah, I'm always wishing for happiness
Let's go to sleep, with a literary air
Goodnight, everyone!

You'll understand my feelings somehow
We're always together, so have they reached you yet?
Maybe I can use telepathy
If our bond is so happy

With words or not, I want to make sure they do
Though I still can't think of how
But it seems like courage is welling up
Little by little I can grow stronger

So tomorrow, with a smile
I'll do my best again, because good fortune starts with a smile
I feel like it's starting
Ah, I tried raising my cheeks in front of a mirror
I was able to smile so beautifully with my strange expression
Goodnight, everyone!

With a smile I think by myself
About the things to look forward to tomorrow
The sky in my heart clears
Ah, I'm always wishing for happiness
Let's go to sleep, with a literary air
Goodnight, everyone!
Smile, we'll see each other again
Goodnight, everyone!
