The starting and finish line can’t be connected
Before I knew it, I start again
That’s great, that’s great, let’s do it just like that!

Starting, road? Start... reload?!

There aren’t enough things
If that’s the case, if that’s the case, let’s add more
Oops, that’s a great answer, because we met I’m not alone

Scold me softly and catch me gently
If you don’t, there’ll be tears
Oops, that’s a big failure, we need to grow up in many ways

What do we want to do?
Let’s be greedy!
There’s no dream that will come true in one go
Nervously, heart-poundingly approach it step by step

Where did it start? I search through my memories
Was it that time? Maybe that time? I can think of a lot
The starting and finish line can’t be connected
Before I knew it, I start again
That’s the reason why, that’s the reason why I can’t stop (I won’t stop)
Where do we want to run? Go! East? Go! West?

Starting, road? Start... reload?!

I took your hand and took your leg, we trudged on
That’s the reason why, that’s the reason why we fall down
Oops, don’t ignore your supernatural abilities or we’ll slip and tumble

But it doesn’t just hurt
It looks different
Today is clearer than yesterday, I can feel it in many ways

What a surprise!
It’s like we evolved?
There are people that want to be energetic
Exciting, heart-sparking, every day is fun

I want to start from now on, when our wishes are born
Let’s take care of them, let’s take care of them, what kind of dreams will they turn into?
The end revolves around the beginning
I can take on a challenge any number of times
Because, because I don’t want to stop
We run amusingly, go! North? Go! South?

To the east, to the west we go, overtake the sun
To the north we go, and the south, go over the glaciers with burning passion

What do we want to do?
Let’s be greedy!
There’s no dream that will come true in one go
Nervously, heart-poundingly approach it step by step

Where did it start? I search through my memories
Was it that time? Maybe that time? I can think of a lot
The starting and finish line can’t be connected
Before I knew it, I start again
That’s the reason why, that’s the reason why I can’t stop (I won’t stop)
Where do we want to run? Go! East? Go! West?

The starting and finish line can’t be connected
The end revolves around the beginning
Before I knew it, I start again
Starting, road? Reload!
