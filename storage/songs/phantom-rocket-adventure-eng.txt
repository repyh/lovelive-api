Through the window I see a rocket, I wonder if it's an illusion (Yes!)
My heart that wants to soar was surely shown
I want to take that one dear person to myself (No!)
But I know that's not right! I want to know more about my true feelings

Likes turn into loves
The fact that everyone believes that is strange, right?
True love is true love
I will always continue with this painful feeling in my chest

In the times I'm afflicted with this lovesickness that swallows up excitement,
I want to see you so badly, I can't sleep
O stars, ah! Let my sighs reach you

It may be an illusion but I want to ride this rocket (Yes!)
In the sands of Mars the two of us will play a game of catch, Start!!
I really want to ask to that really ambiguous one (No!)
But I know that I still can't! When it will be the time?

Love is eternal
Thinking of believing those words is stupid, isn't it?
Love, same as with likes
Unexpectedly can break away and disappear to the other side of the universe

Why is an everyday life that's swallowed too much excitement a sin?
Our meeting is taking a wrong twist
These bad wishes, Ah! Don't ever stop them

Let's kiss outside of this world, no one will never-ever know
Even if thereâ€™s a dozen of kisses, no one will never-ever know

Likes turn into loves
The fact that everyone believes that is strange, right?
True love is true love
I will always continue with this painful feeling in my chest

In the times I'm afflicted with this lovesickness that swallows up excitement,
I want to see you so badly, I can't sleep
O stars, ah! Let my sighs reach you
