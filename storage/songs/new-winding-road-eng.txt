If you close your eyes
There'll be a song that will suddenly cross your mind
My heart continually whispers that we can return to that time

The sun is different yet the same
I realized, once I was carried far away
It might be too late but I'll try to tell you
It won't be now; it'll be further in the future

Stay cheerful, everyone, in hopes that we can meet again
Our feelings of wanting to meet is what connects us
Oh until then, let's try to do our best
By ourselves, until the day we can talk together again
Vividly, I see our dream once again
To seek a radiant light
We face ahead towards someplace new
Where will this path we set out on lead to?

I recall
The wind by the seashore
My heart will never forget the color of the sky back then

The cityscape, so gentle,
Becomes so vibrant at a distance
I loved it, but I couldn't stay still
We each must search for our own place

We face ahead, walk towards someplace new
Will the path always be straight? Probably not

So stay cheerful, everyone, in hopes that we can meet again
Our feelings of wanting to meet is what connects us
Oh until then, let's try to do our best
By ourselves, until the day we can talk together again
Once you've set out, let's try to dream again
Let's go search for that radiant light
