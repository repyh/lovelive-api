Let's decide what to do next
I want to play with you, to smile with you

I feel like when we're together, we can do anything!
After all, just being here proves that
Now let's go beyond this dream we've realized
And find a new dream
I can see it in your eyes
Aah, you're waiting for excitement
Of course, we are too!

So come along, so come along
You'll be left behind if you don't hurry
It's a journey to a fun world, Yay!
Everyone come along, do come along!
It'll be lively if we're all together
With our power and your heart, let's face tomorrow

We got here through hard work and be listening to your voice
Responding "Don't succumb, you can't lose!"
We want to give shape to all kinds of dreams
Let's search for them
You're here
Ahh, the future is warm
Since you'll be with us always!

Forever, Forever
These bonds are unbreakable
We run with the same thoughts, Yay!
Everyone forever, Forever
Look at this eternal dream
With our power and your heart, it's a parade!

We're happy, we want to say it after all
Yay yay, thank you always
Shall we start something again?
Let's do it, we want to begin, everyone together!

Forever, forever
With these unbreakable bonds
Seems everyone's shouting
Yeah Hop, Step, Yay!

So come along, so come along
You'll be left behind if you don't hurry
Everyone come along, do come along!
It'll be lively if we're all together
With our power and your heart, let's face tomorrow
Hooray! Yay!
