There are many wonderful things to be discovered
It's because I believed that I could meet you
pa-pa doo-wop dream!

I want to get closer to you, I want to hold your hand
I'm still very excited right now, though
pa-pa doo-wop dream!

I like what I see... Even my heart agrees with me
"Let's go ahead, I'm sure it'll work out somehow!"
Looks like there's no other choice

I want to catch my dreams as I smile at all the people
Really? Really? This might all depend on me
Because I feel like that's how it is for some reason
I won't be giving up anymore, I'll just continue running!

Sometimes, you just can't rely on miracles alone
So just use all the power that you can
pa-pa doo-wop dream!

Even if I see that you're going away
I might just wake up and stand up for myself
pa-pa doo-wop dream!

I really like you... I might do it again and try even harder than before
"This is pretty fun, I'm finally managing it!"
Looks like there's no other choice

If you just keep on dreaming, you can make any of your dreams come true
Really? Really? I'm really not lost
Let's try to fly as hard as possible
I just can't stay sad like this, I'll just continue running!

Try to connect the dreams that you like
I say "Never giving up!"

I want to catch my dreams as I smile at all the people
