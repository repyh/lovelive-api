Shine!
My heart started beating quickly
It's all because I saw you there!

"I want to give it a go"
My throbbing heart still couldn't determine how confused I am
Even so, I finally chose to start as it might just be destiny
Our feelings are coming together

We don't know what will occur next (What should we do?)
Even so, I keep going forward with these expectations of mine (Let's jump!)
This grim attitude will disappear one day
Let's be vitality and go forward in a vital way!

Shine!
My heart started beating quickly
When I felt this, (right here) I saw you there
Shine!
I found it with my passionate heart
This light (Is very pretty) and is a lot brighter (Our bright wish)
If you love it, it will be alright!

"Let's do it"
Even if we can't find some suitable words to describe our determination
Anyway, we will start to regret it if we don't start right now
We should do something so we need to force ourselves to fly

I want to start planning our future but where should we go? (Go forward with whom?)
The fantastic stage which we have never seen before (It's our chance!)
Don't be afraid and don't stop
Let's be courageous as courage is our high power

Bright!
If an idea comes to my mind
I will do my best to make it come true (Magnificent) You can't just ignore it
Bright!
A small thought is also interesting
Can't you see this tendency? (It's starting to rise) That's why it's bright (And it changed to ambition)
Because if you love it, it must be alright!

We don't know what will occur next
Even so, I keep going forward with these expectations of mine
This grim attitude will disappear one day
Let's be vigorous and keep going forward vigorously!

Shine! Bright!
My heart started beating quickly
When I felt this, (right here) I saw you there
Shine!
I found it with my passionate heart
This light (Is very pretty) and is a lot brighter (Our bright wish)
If you love it, it will be alright!
