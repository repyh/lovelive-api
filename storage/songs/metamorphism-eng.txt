My wings have been born...

What are you wishing for,
While alone in that tight capsule
We hide the fact that we want to touch
We'll become small butterflies and dance

If wanting to be just a bit closer is a sin,
Then this temptation must've started while we were still in chrysalis
These wings have given me freedom
So, whisper your taboo dreams here

Who are you searching for?
I've finally come to understand
That through our fated meeting
We've come to know that this pain is so sweet

Just a bit further, if we change more
We'll suddenly be able to see the future... We aren't in denial
Even if our wings are torn, it's fine
Come, we'll capture everything here, as our dreams unfold

Try to take flight
Hurry up!
If you try it out, you'll find that you can break free of your body

If wanting to be just a bit closer is a sin,
Then this temptation must've started while we were still in chrysalis
These wings have given me freedom
This is the middle of a forbidden dream
A little is not enough to satisfy us
We can see the future that we desire now... that's how it works, right?
Even if our wings are torn, it's fine
Come, we'll capture everything here, as our dreams unfold
