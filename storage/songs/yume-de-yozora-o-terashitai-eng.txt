So, are feelings all I have?
That's not true! Come here, if you look with your heart's eyes
You'll see that everyone wishes for something
Let's try sensing that in this place

The shine of starlight on the waves is the color of faraway ideals
If you believe your wish will be granted
Then I'm sure you'll see the path towards your future

It could be a flight of stairs or maybe a gateway, dreams probably come in all shapes and sizes
Now connect, everyone connect, let's go light up the night sky

What will never ever fade
Are the sights that made us who we are now
So that we never ever erase them
Let's start right here, let's move forward next time

Is it a flight of stairs, or could it be a gate?
When you've found a dream to ask that about......I whispered, "I'm glad".

It’s okay to just start with the shape, right?
If your heart is fluttering, being led by your longings
A power resides within every person
The power to fly with those precious to us

Aiming our eyes at the sky, a small light is rising, carrying our feelings
I believe our wish will be granted
We have now opened the path to our future

Is this a promise or maybe a prayer? From now on our dreams will grow bigger
Now connect, everyone connect so that we’ll light up the night sky

Don’t ever, ever disappear
I have finally realized that this is my passion
I will never ever erase it
Let's start right here, let's move forward next time

I want to make a promise that we’ll pray and work hard
I found a dream I want to realize, I’ll always hold dear this joy

What will never ever fade
Are the sights that made us who we are now
So that we never ever erase them
Let's start right here,, let's move forward next time

Is it a flight of stairs or could it be a gate?
When you've found a dream to ask that about...I whispered, "I'm glad"
