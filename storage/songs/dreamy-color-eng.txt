Dreamy Aqours color...

Today, I'll fly over, depending on how I feel
I want to really feel the present
Live in this moment; just looking across the clear, blue sky
I'll always be happy

Ah, although the wind's direction will change
The passion for my dreams won't change
I'll still run, even when I'm out of breath - I can do it, I can do it!
I'll wake up the strength resting inside

It's starting, it's starting, once you want to start something
That's the moment, that's when it's born - a new excitement
It didn't exist yesterday, but it appeared suddenly, and started moving
It's starting, it's starting, once you want to start something
That's the moment, that's when it's born - a new excitement
You stretch out your hands, I like that about you
As long as we're having fun, anything goes
Come on, let's fly!

The world is always turning
That's why the scenery we see changes
At some point, this moment will also become a memory
And the blue sky, a sunset, and then a sunrise

Ah, there'll be a different color to the wind, won't there?
I was next to you, and I looked over and felt sad
Then our eyes met, for now I'll just smile
With that, my sadness disappears
My loneliness disappears

It's fun, it's fun, the first time doing something
It's drawing me, drawing me, a new challenge
I want to meet this feeling, over and over
I want to go further and further
Together, of course!

The color of the future keeps changing, however,
Our feelings will never change, I want to show them to you
They're here, and they'll always stay here
I believe that I've expressed them to you
Because I can hear your voice
Your song has reached my heart...

It's starting, it's starting, once you want to start something
That's the moment, that's when it's born - a new excitement
It didn't exist yesterday, but it appeared suddenly, and started moving
It's starting, it's starting, once you want to start something
That's the moment, that's when it's born - a new excitement
You stretch out your hands, I like that about you
As long as we're having fun, anything goes
Come on, let's fly!

What color do our souls take on when we give our all?
What color do we take on when we dream?
What color do our souls take on when we give our all?
What color do we take on when we dream?
