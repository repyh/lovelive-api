Something's awakened within me;
A feeling to which I've yet to put a name
Is now looking towards a new tomorrow
 
If you want to get moving,
All you need is courage and a catalyst
Come on! Let's take our first leap together!
 
Searching for something to do?
How about going on an adventure!
Sitting there undecided won't change anything
Have faith in your own strength!
 
It all begins with your sky
What kinds of dreams are you drawing out up there? Please tell me!
Before we wish on the stars, I want to talk
I want to share my excitement!
Once we all begin, your sky
Is hiding a path to the future somewhere, I wonder where it is?
I'm sure it's somewhere out there, let's go find it!
If we hold hands... I won't be scared!
 
That something within me;
A feeling to which I've yet to put a name,
Is very dear to me
 
That initial feeling of excitement,
Have you felt it yet?
Now! Let's go take our first leap together!
 
Wanting to do something fun?
How about challenging yourself!
Failure is just your way of preparing for success
Have faith in your own dreams!
 
I want to begin dreaming
I have things to say to you, so please listen!
Though we're far from being as radiant as a star just yet
I have a feeling we'll grow much brighter someday
 
It all begins with your sky
What kinds of dreams are you drawing out up there? Please tell me!
Before we wish on the stars, I want to talk
I want to share my excitement!
Once we all begin, your sky
Is hiding a path to the future somewhere, I wonder where it is?
I'm sure it's somewhere out there, let's go find it!
If we hold hands... I won't be scared!
Let's take a leap into our first sky!
