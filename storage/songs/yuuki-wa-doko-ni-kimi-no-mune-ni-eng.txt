Try and be brave
I know it's actually scary
It's not like I was able to do it from the start either

I messed up a lot
I was really frustrated
But that gave me strength, so don't give up

Your eyes are wet, saying they want to try believing
Say bye bye to your hesitation and tears
Now, let's go!

Let's chase them as many times as it takes and don't lose
Everyone fails sometimes
But dreams won't fade, dreams won't fade
Let's chase them as many times as it takes and don't lose
Because today after all is today and once you wake up, it'll be a new morning

We know that now is
The time to get serious
If we run away it'll always weigh on our hearts

If you can't do it,
Then grab the next chance
Start running, break a sweat, just don't give up

Believe in the strength that's yours alone
The strength that you're trying to meet
We have to go to make sure
So let's go with a smile!

This time let's decide that we'll find it for sure
We'll keep running and catch our future
We have a lot of dreams, we have a lot of dreams
This time let's decide that we'll find it for sure
Have more courage, bring out more as you have that courage

There's nothing I've left undone
Is what I want to say, but when will that be?
It's still a long way to then and as it's a challenge, we'll work hard
Ah I'm starting to understand the meaning of getting passionate

Our hearts desire to feel pride
We'll keep running and catch our future
We have a lot of dreams, we have a lot of dreams, our dreams won't fade...

Let's chase them as many times as it takes, don't lose
Everyone fails sometimes
But dreams won't fade, dreams won't fade
Let's chase them as many times as it takes, don't lose
Because today, after all is today and once you wake up, it'll be a new morning
Ah, the sun is smiling down on you
