I get it, I say as I pout
I tried to put together all the things
I want to tell my lover who I'll meet someday
Doesn't "MY LIST"...look impressive?

Be sure to contact me, every single day
Let me hear that you'll love me forever over and over
Always!

Call me by my name, no need to bother with formalities
Let's walk, hand in hand, not minding what anyone else thinks

When I stay quiet it's because I can't say it,
I'll show you this list, and try acting a bit spoiled
My lover who I'll meet some day, don't be shocked
"MY LOVE"...where will we meet?

Don't keep saying you're busy
If you keep putting off my feelings of love,
I'll start to cry!

When you leave me to go out, buy me a souvenir and come back
Even if you don't know my star sign, just remember my birthday

Let me hear that you love me all the time
Don't you want to say it?

There's lots and lots more, but let's leave it for after we meet,
To look forward to
Who are you? Where are you?
C'mon, come to me quickly, quickly, show me your face
Hey, come to me quickly!
