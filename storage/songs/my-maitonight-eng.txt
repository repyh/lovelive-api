Dance, dance, to find a passion
We were probably born for this very purpose

If the flames that are still small now
Become one, a miracle will be born
This world will always give to unyielding hearts
Not answers, but clues to search for their own path
So let's strongly go until the end

Dance, dance, to find a passion - were we born for this very purpose?
Dance, dance, surely it is so
So let's dream and let's dance

MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) is the very best
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) let's make that today

Someday we'll spread out... there! Spread wide!
With the strength of our hard work we call forth a miracle
In this world, hearts that want to shine
When gathered together, will think of something new and run
We can't see beneath our feet, but we stretch out our arms like wings

Dance, dance,　we yearn to be a light that shines forever
Dance, dance, "Surely some day,
It will come true," is our dance

My dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) to the future
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) connect me!

Guided by a voice inside, the road is open once again
So let's go strongly until the end

Dance, dance, to find a passion - were we born for this very purpose?
Dance, dance, surely it is so
So let's dream and let's dance

MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) is the very best
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) let's make that today
