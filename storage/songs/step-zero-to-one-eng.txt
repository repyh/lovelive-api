It's an adventure we're on, though I was alone at first
I finally encountered everyone else by chance
Courage is needed for the first step from zero; I want to change, so Step! All right!!

The seeds of doubt have sprouted and grown leaves
Let’s pluck them out, those worries
Let’s spread some better seeds, ones that sing out our dream

If you walk along the streets, you'll hear the invitation of the changing seasons
My feet are involuntarily dancing a new beat, towards where you are

It's contradictory to count your anxieties while seeking excitement
ah! This hazy heart
Please tell me what I have to do to make it clear

In times that seem like they can change, and even times that don't, I can feel it so
This time round, this time round
Let's open the door from zero to one; It's a time I want to change
Maybe the future from here onwards will remain a mystery
ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE…STEP!
ZERO to ONE, Steppin' my heart!

Even lost flowers wait in hope,
for the light of day when they'll bloom!
So shall we become beautiful flowers, that look like a dream

While rushing towards tomorrow, I want to spend today enjoying the present
ah! This wavering heart
Please tell me what I have to do to make it steady

In times that seem like they can move, and even times that don't, without hesitation
This time round, this time round
Let's cross the difference between zero to one; It seems I want things to move
But you know, the future from here onwards will remain a mystery
ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE…STEP!
ZERO to ONE, Steppin' my heart!

In times that seem like they can change, and even times that don't, I can feel it so
This time round, this time round
Let's open the door from zero to one; It's a time I want to change
Maybe the future from here onwards will remain a mystery

It's an adventure we're on, though I was alone at first
I finally encountered everyone else by chance
Courage is needed for the first step from zero; Let's get moving, Step! All right!!
