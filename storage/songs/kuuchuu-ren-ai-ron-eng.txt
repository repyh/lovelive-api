My emotions are Super flying
Like a gust of wind
Your voice is unlike anyone else's
Since the moment I heard it
I thought it may be love
Ah! My heart may as well explode

When I woke up
I wondered where I was; was I still dreaming?
Heaven and Earth were upside down
Let's try to calm down

Don't try to settle the issue by common knowledge
Cause this heart of mine is burning hot
It's already flown off, hasn't it?
Where in the world could you be right now?
I don't know...

Through this imaginary Super world
I am wandering
I dreamed of chasing after you
I believe I'm awake now
And I want to see you
Ah! My heart may as well explode

Melting ever so faintly
I want to keep mulling over how I should start
If you knew you can't go back
Would you still begin?

Just talking about love in theory
Your heart will never feel pain
But still I want to know about
These sweet tears that won't ever reach

My emotions are Super flying
Like a gust of wind
Your voice is unlike anyone else's
Since the moment I heard it
I thought it may be love
Ah! My heart may as well explode

Within and after a dream there's a feeling of togetherness like dancing through the air
But more than a point of argument, it's blunt evidence
That I just want to drift away with you, Super flying babyÔºÅ

Through this imaginary Super world
I am wandering
I dreamed of chasing after you
I believe I'm awake now
And I want to see you
Ah! My heart may have exploded

My emotions are Super flying
Like a gust of wind
Your voice is unlike anyone else's
Since the moment I heard it
I thought it may be love
Ah! My heart may as well explode
