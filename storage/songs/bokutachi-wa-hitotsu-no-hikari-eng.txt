Ah! It began with a subtle premonition
Ah! Our wishes were hung amidst the starry skies
Our joyful smiles that make flowers bloom,
They were always the same, smiles of friendship

We won't ever forget this, until the end of time
That our hearts can become one like this
We've discovered the world
So let us sing with joy until the very end

The little bird's wings have finally grown large
It's a day to take flight
The wide sea's warm color beckons in the distance
It's painful, just like a painting drawn within a dream
Would you like to try winding back time?
No no no, this moment is the greatest!

These encounters with everyone
Were so joyful I never wanted to let go, it's true
Our tears are unneeded, let's just dance like this
Wave your hands, wave them more

We made it here chasing the light. Because it's us,
We won't say farewell
We'll meet again, won't you call me?
We're a dream
That connects to a wonderful future
A future we dreamed of
Our LIVE & LIFE with you
