Is this the fragrance of an open flower? I've received this next dream
Now, where should we go?
Should we go as if we were leaping ahead?
Repeating (the farewells) and the beginnings

What I want to meet is a new kind of excitement, a newborn wish's warmth
I want to embrace it
I want to lightly go towards it with my memories stuffed inside my pocket

Let's go on a wonderful journey
After all, life connects us to so many places
It's nothing but thrilling!

Carrying along these feelings, we'll go to the HAPPY HAPPY TRAIN!
Tomorrow is calling
If our eyes are shining with hopes, we can see it
In this distant train station, something is waiting for us

What I want to know is wonderful daybreak, a sunset that would house my pain
That's why I have to go now
Alone if I have to, singing to myself my memories

I won't worry about the small things
I want to always be smiling
Let's go on a never ending journey
Life just makes us sigh sometimes
As thrilling as it can be

When I rode with no hesitation on the PARTY PARTY TRAIN
There were surprising people by my side
How far does the rail go? I still don't know
I want this PARTY TRAIN to run forever


Carrying along these feelings, we'll go to the HAPPY HAPPY TRAIN!
Tomorrow is calling us
When I rode with no hesitation on the PARTY PARTY TRAIN
There were surprising people by my side
If our eyes are shining with hopes, we can see it
In this distant train station, something is waiting for us
Ah, the Happy Train goes anywhere, doesn't it?
