(1,2,3!)

Once I relax my body and mind,
I can go anywhere in this world
Hey, who am I really?
Maybe I should have been a fish

I'll just relax and admire the view as I float
This sky I'm familiar with is so beautiful!
Ah, let's just dissolve into the clear blue water

The waves sing as they gently ebb and flow
Feeling really nice against my tanned skin
My worries just disappear when I close my eyes to block out the bright sun

All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
Swim towards
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
The future where freedom awaits them
These ever-changing dreams bop up and down upon the waves
Never to be caught, but I'll chase after them!
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
Swim with ease towards
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
The future where freedom awaits them
Holding nothing but their hopes and dreams
When tomorrow comes, I'll play with them in this ocean!

When I start to feel stressed, I'll try to relax
In some water that'll be saltier than my tears
I don't want to cry anymore
So I'll duck my head beneath the surface

Hidden under the sand, are many seashells
Quickly now, pick them up before they float away
Oh how strange, they're empty. Let's put them back where I found them

All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
Swim towards
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
The future where freedom awaits them
These ever-changing dreams bop up and down upon the waves
Never to be caught, but I'll chase after them!
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
Swim with ease towards
All-these-fish, all-these-fish, all-these-fish
The future where freedom awaits them
Holding nothing but their hopes and dreams
When tomorrow comes, I'll play with them in this ocean!

I am a fish
Well, that is how I feel anyway
Slowly opening my eyes, remembering I have legs
I have to stand up since I'm human, I have to go back to the shore
Even so, at least I feel more relaxed
