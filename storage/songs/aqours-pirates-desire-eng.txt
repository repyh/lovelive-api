Demons dwell in the sea in the dark depths of night
We want this and we want that, it’s irresistible

Like the tears of a mermaid, pearls and the such are wonderful
Shall we adorn our chests with them? It’ll surely look good on us
Oh! Plunder Oh! The treasure
Oh! Plunder it Oh! We’re pirates!!

We’ll do whatever we please
Our bodies will move the moment we feel that desire
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan
Beat the signal drums
We’ll do whatever we please
If we desire something, our determination won’t be stopped
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan
Dan-Da-Dan We’ll steal it

There are more than seven oceans in this wide world
Whatever place catches our interest, then we’ll capture it
Oh! Advance Oh! Across the sea
Oh! Advance We’re pirates!!

It doesn’t matter what it is, it’s all ours
If that’s the case, then why don’t we try to take it now
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan
When the drums of victory beat
Everything is all ours
So we’ll grab it all now, that’ll be good
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan
Dan-Da-Dan We’ll steal it

This red flag of freedom will run wild in the wind
The black crossbones will overcome the rough waves

We’ll do whatever we please
Our bodies will move the moment we feel that desire
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan Dan-Da-Dan We won’t be stopped
We’ll do whatever we please
If we desire something, our determination won’t be stopped
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan
Dan-Da-Dan We’ll steal! Oh pirates!!
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan Dan-Da-Dan Everything there is
Dan-Da-Dan Da-Dan Da-Dan Dan-Da-Dan We’ll steal it!
