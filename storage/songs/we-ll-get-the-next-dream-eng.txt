We want to be strong. Really strong. What for? To protect you!

We'll get the next dream we don't give up
We'll get the next dream oh we don't give up
We never give up!

Even though it's so painful right now, beyond the darkness is a
Shining world - My shining world
"Ah, I can't do this!"
We'll grab your hand and do anything to help you

We can become stronger, we really can be
When we protect others, that's when
We can become even stronger, we really can be
We're running and fighting our way through the present

We don't give up
No matter what happens, we'll figure it out
No matter what happens in the world, we'll bring back the light

Please believe in us (Oh, yeah!)
Please believe in us (Oh, yeah!)
For better or for worse, we can't lie to you
Please believe in us (Oh, yeah!)
Please believe in us (Oh, yeah!)
We'll get back up again and again

We'll get the next dream, with this
We'll get the next dream, new power
We'll get the next dream!!!

The right words have been erased by this
Dark world - ah, what a fleeting pure world
"I can't go on like this anymore!"
It'll be okay! If you're with me, we can go on!

We're all frustrated, we really are
No one can make contact with each other
We're all frustrated, we really are
But we can endure this and fight back

We don't give up
No matter what happens, we'll figure it out
No matter what happens in the world, I want to dance with you

Let's play again (Oh, yeah!)
Let's play again (Oh, yeah!)
For better or for worse, the world's rules always change
Let's play again (Oh, yeah!)
Let's play again (Oh, yeah!)
I want to meet you again, someday

We'll get the next dream, with this
We'll get the next dream, new power
We'll get the next dream!!!

Can we believe that what we wish for from the bottom of our hearts will come true?
All we need now is that next dream, so unleash it!

We'll get the next dream, with this
We'll get the next dream, new power
We'll get the next dream!!!
