The sound of rain beats against my window
And from the sky sadness like my own pours down, endlessly drenching the present
I don't need things like memories
They only make my heart hurt
No more! September Rain
No more! September Rain

You were always by my side
And it was never necessary
To go out of the way to make sure of your feelings

I wonder if, because we naturally got along,
I hadn't been worried at all
Why? I ask the waves, but

I didn't know the thoughts that the beginning of summer brought me
Would disappear by the time
This exciting, passionate season ended

The sky above the coast lights up, but suddenly clouds have drifted in
The rain falls heavily, just like the tears inside me
I really believed a summer this fun
Would continue on forever
But now... September Rain
But now... September Rain

Sooner or later these memories will fade away
They'll be buried with the countless changing of seasons
And then will I be able to smile?

The beginning of summer (with its scorching rays)
Is full of sweet expectations (premonitions of meetings)
When summer ends, they'll disappear. Isn't it painful?
No one is around, I'm all alone

The sound of rain beats against my window
And from the sky sadness like my own pours down, endlessly drenching the present
I don't need things like memories
They only make my heart hurt
No more! September Rain
No more! September Rain

The sky above the coast lights up, but suddenly clouds have drifted in
The rain falls heavily, just like the tears inside me
I really believed a summer this fun
Would continue on forever
But now... September Rain
But now... September Rain
