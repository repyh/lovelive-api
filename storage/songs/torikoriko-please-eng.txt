I believe in the magic of words
You'll someday become my captive
Always look at me no matter what!! PLEASE

I'll make preparations
I don't know which words can convey my love
Though my sighs convey my passion

Just once, if there ever was a chance
When will that time ever be... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! No one knows any shortcuts to love
But, hey? LOVE ME!
"Because I'll make you happy"
Maybe this is correct? The magic spell of love

Even if I wait, you won't look back
You're just a friend like always
Notice my surging heart!! PLEASE

I want to infer
I don't know which words can make you my captive
Acting casually even though I'm observing you

If that chance was given to someone else
No way, I don't want you taken away... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! Maybe I'm just in love with the concept of love
Hey, that may be fun too, right?

Just once, if there ever was a chance
When will that time ever be... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! No one knows any shortcuts to love
But, hey? LOVE ME!
"Because I'll make you happy"
Maybe this is correct? The magic spell of love
