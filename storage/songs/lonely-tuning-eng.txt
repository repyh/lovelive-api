(DJ time, DJ time) Our hearts that want to meet
(Happy time, happy time) I want to connect them
Listen, listen, I’m always
Looking for you

"I’ve given up on everything
I just want to go home for today"
Those sighs have arrived here, arrived at my side

We’ve never stopped trying our best
Our missions are like that sometimes
I want to save you with this song

(DJ night, DJ night) Those songs
(Happy night, happy night)
That you loved
Let’s broadcast them, let them reach you quickly
I want to cheer you up (Reach out, reach out, to you)
Let’s broadcast them (Reach out, reach out, hurry up)

What is it you want to do?
There are times when you lose sight of it
Let's go home already
Today, you should rest a little

I know that we're doing our best
It's alright, and you know it too
Someday, it'll turn out well
So let's rest a little now

Can you hear
My voice?
Let's be in tune together
Tune yourself to me

(Stay tuned)

(DJ time, DJ time) Our hearts that want to meet
(Happy time, happy time) I want to connect them
Listen, listen, I’m always
Looking for you

(DJ night, DJ night) Those songs
(Happy night, happy night)
That you loved
Let’s broadcast them, let them reach you quickly
I want to cheer you up (Reach out, reach out, to you)
Let’s broadcast them (Reach out, reach out, hurry up)
