That's right!
Wanting to shine, wanting to start,
Meeting new friends, we ran along this path
From zero to one, how difficult that was,
But what happened then (But what happened then) that became a connection

That's right!
Not knowing anything, in between sweat and tears,
Our friends encouraging us, we ran along this path
Looking up at the open sky, we talked like this every day
That's why we all (That's why we all) could give it our all!

Our dreams have always been in our hearts
Even when we thought we'd lost sight of them
And that's why we are never giving up!
Because we finally saw that light
And if we became even more enraptured, we believed that things will definitely change
With all of you

That's right!
One after another, all my wishes came true
Realising we were glad to have our friends by our side, we ran along this path
But, you see, after our parting, any number of things could happen
So where should we go? (Where should we go?) To each of our own goals!

Further on, let's keep running, there's no other choice
Is what we've decided, but we still worry, you know?
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because, after all, we want to feel passionate
And we want to see a dream in a different form

Aah, what should we do? (If we turn to face)
Aah, what should we do? (Tomorrow)
Do they know?
Do they know?
Do our future selves know...?

That's right...
Casting a spell that's special to us,
Receiving our friends' warm wishes as they see us off...
It's not a zero, it's all right, let's cheer up, let's laugh it off!
Let's give it a shot (let's give it a shot) We can still give it some more!

Further on, let's keep running, there's no other choice
Knowing that, we'll start to run
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because, after all, we want to feel passionate
And we want to see a dream in a different form

So when the curtain rises up we are going to sing forever
And an endless dream we will see!
