Ready?
I won't wait for you...Love!!

I found you!
Your eyes looked lonely
Your heartbeat's calling out, saying "take me into your hands"
Feeling so much heat but calm on the outside, I can enjoy that
Hold down those growing feelings

Quietly, collecting information about you
Certainly, there's value in a sensitive mind
Stepping up in the background, the thrill is unbearable
Because once I've chosen my target, you can't run away. You can't run away, my target!!

(Trap in Dice)　I want to start
(Trap in Night)　From a trap of love
(Trap in Heart)　While dancing, playing the roulette of life
(It's fate) Ordinary is boring
I want to feel special
I want to steal you away
I won't wait for you...Love!!

I want to see
Your frightened face
I'm sure I'm making an awful face when I scheme about it
What I want to get, is that heart of yours
Fragile and uncertain kindness

To you, who loves quiet and solitude
I'm firing an undeniable brilliant light
I want to make you mine before you can realize
My target is decided, you can't run away. You can't run away, my target!!

(Trick in Dice)　If I wager on love
(Trick in Night)　You can't back out
(Trick in Heart)　Life is a roulette I can only win
(It's fate) Meeting you knowing that is wonderful
If I feel special

"Come into my possession"
That hidden voice has the smell of berries, trap in one night
A red berry, sweetly, strongly overflowing

(Trick in Dice)　If I wager on love
(Trick in Night)　You can't back out
(Trick in Heart)　Life is a roulette I can only win
(Trap in Dice)　I want to start
(Trap in Night)　From a trap of love
(Trap in Heart)　While dancing, play the roulette of life
(It's fate) Ordinary is boring
I want to feel special
I want to steal you away
I won't wait for you, sweet, sweet berry
Red temptation in your heart, Berry Trapper, I've chosen my target
