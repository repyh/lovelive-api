I just can't get to sleep, I can't sleep tonight at all
My thoughts are keeping me up
It's like the night sky knows everything

I couldn't show her kindness
While she was crying
"It's unfair, you know. I want to cry too," I thought

I was a bit cruel
My words were harsh, and now I'm regretting it
Took me long enough, but, I'm sorry...

I just can't get to sleep, I can't sleep tonight at all
My thoughts are keeping me up
All I do is toss and turn
She's my precious friend, I've got to be open with her
I'll try speaking my mind, not just moping around
Ah, it's like the night sky knows everything about me... does it know?

Even though I know we love each other, sometimes we disagree
I guess it really was my fault.. I shouldn't have lost my temper
Now I just want to hug you softly

Rather than just offer words of comfort, I want to gently pat your back
Hug you and whisper 'it's okay'
Took me long enough, but, I'm sorry...

"Don't cry alone, let's cry together"
That's a relief, I'm glad
We were trying too hard to act strong
She's my precious friend, I should be crying by her side
If we share to lighten the weight, then maybe someday they'll become smiles

To the night sky, I whisper "I'm sorry"

I just can't get to sleep, I can't sleep tonight at all
My thoughts are keeping me up
All I do is toss and turn
She's my precious friend, I've got to be open with her
I'll try speaking my mind, not just moping around
Ah, it's like the night sky knows everything about me... does it know?

I couldn't show her kindness
And now, I regret it
