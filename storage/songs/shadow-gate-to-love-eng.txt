When you think you want something more
Take a look at that dark staircase
In the place where light doesn't shine, a door is opening (You need me)

Try tempting me with those strong-scented eyes of yours
This night overflowing with hidden desire might be stimulating
Now, what do you want to do?

My shadow wants to swallow up
This dream of yours
It's okay to fall in love, a trap was set with these sighs
It's probably taking effect now, aren't you numb?

Not everyone can see it
Only you were selected
A door that opens in that place where you refused light (You want me)

A spell is the number of kisses I'd like to try someday
An impure night in which we ask "what if", will be stimulating
Now, what shall we do?

You and I conflict like two sides of a coin
Changing into love
If it is a beautiful lie, it should be forgiven
That's why you also whisper words of love

Surely I can meet you before that door disappears.
Yes, I can hear your footsteps,
Now's the moment!

My shadow wants to swallow up
This dream of yours
It's okay to fall in love, a trap was set with these sighs
It's probably taking effect now, aren't you numb?

You and I conflict like two sides of a coin
Changing into love
If it is a beautiful lie, it should be forgiven
That’s why you and I both whisper words of a fantastical love

Oh baby Shadow gate！It's okay to fall in love
Oh baby Shadow gate！It's okay to fall in love
