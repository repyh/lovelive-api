Have the signs disappeared...?
My breathing is rough and violent just like the clues we follow
We're searching while not wanting to ever find it
But as soon as we do, we must take the chance to strike

Why must you be an enemy? (Surely nobody knows)
When I'm so attracted to you (I don't know the truth)
It must be a bad dream

This Daydream of light and darkness (daydreamer)
Beyond that black door,
What awaits me is (Destiny's) embrace of my Lost Love
At the very least, I must forget your kindness from that day
Wiping the sweat from my brow, I swear I'll end it all with my own hands

Feigning not hearing the voice of my heart
As I begin to run, my contradictions waver
These beloved feelings, these unforgivable feelings
I want to confirm them; weakness is painful

Why did I ever meet you? (My burning chest flutters)
I felt a definite link between us (I wanted to believe it wasn't a lie)
But this illusion has crumbled to pieces, hasn't it?

My prayers and love are a Daydream (Daydreamer)
Dreams can only be dreams
At the end of grief (Destiny is) now an unchanging Lost love
Until I can overcome it, I'll swallow back those tears
With my back against a dark wall, I will sharpen my senses for battle

I want to return to this day...to the day we met...
But this one wish of mine won't come true; it must be a bad dream

This Daydream of light and darkness (daydreamer)
Beyond that black door,
What awaits me is (Destiny's) embrace of my Lost Love
At the very least, I must forget your kindness from that day
Wiping the sweat from my brow, I swear I'll end it all with my own hands
