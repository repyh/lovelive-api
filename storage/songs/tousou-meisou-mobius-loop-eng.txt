Should we go over there? (Oh no!)
Should we go over here? (Oh no!)
Which way should we go to? We don-don-don-don't know!

Go! We always want to live with this freedom
Oh yeah! We just noticed it
So come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye

While we're running around, thinking without a care
Sweaty and impatient Oh, man it's too hot
If we raised our voices too much, they might find us
So by reading our lips we can talk the day away

Going up, down, and up again (this looks like a maze)
Crossing here, turning there and again (we are running away)
I think I ran too much and it's getting painful
Why are we all laughing? We cannot stop it now

That is why even if I'm the one who's being chased
Even if you really are chasing me
Going around and around, we are drawing a full circle
Even though we don't want to be caught we sure would like to see you try
This has slowly came to be fun so Runaway Forever!?

We want to live with more of this freedom
Oh yeah We just noticed it
So come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye

If you get tired, that would be a problem
I'm getting really thirsty Oh man, that sure hurts!
If you think you may be somewhat cold-hearted
The people over here seem to be nice and warm

Going up, down, and up again (Oh no I slipped)
Crossing here, turning there and again (shall we fly away?)
I was running out of breath and that was my limit
But our feet are leading the way so come on, we are not going to stop!

We knew that we're just being chased around
That's one thing we can't go back on
Going around and around, we are swirling like a soup
It is slowly being boiled down, do you think it's time to taste it?
Will it be hot? Sure it is hot! But we don't notice it!

Around the Mobius Loop, around the Mobius Loop
We want to always run away and be chased!

We knew that we were just being chased around
That's one thing we can't go back on
Going around and around, we are swirling like a soup
It is slowly being boiled down, do you think it's time to taste it?
Will it be hot? Sure it is hot! It's nature is being hot!

Even if I'm the one who's being chased
Even if you really are chasing me
Going around and around, we are drawing a full circle
Even though we don't want to be caught we sure would like to see you try
This has slowly came to be fun so Runaway Forever!?
Escaping the Mobius Loop or Runaway runaway forever!?

We always want to live with this freedom
Oh yeah We just noticed it
Come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye
