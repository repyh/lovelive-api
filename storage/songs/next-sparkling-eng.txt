All of these memories are important and always will be
This wonderful thing is our one and only precious gift
No matter how far it is
I'm sure you can see this beautiful scenery
Inside your heart, because deep down are your feelings

I want to see even if it's this once
Closing your eyes and together
We can all hear that song
Where should we be heading to? Let's go together!

We will not forget, we're sure we won't as long as we have dreams
There's someone we all want to become someday
We will not forget, never forget what it means to believe
Surely after tomorrow, I will be closer to my dreams

Even if I was alone, I always felt the same way and that made me think
That this feeling was a cherishble and made me not let it go
This bond, this wonderful story that will never disappear
All the things I've been able to achieve
Are amazing! Thank you my friends

I want to finally see it
Do you get it? I want to call everyone here
With this song that we always hear
There's a long way to go, let's go together!

It will never stop, I'm sure it won't this warm throb
You and I will always be connected from this point onwards
It will never stop, I'm sure it won't get even more warm
Let's go on as our hands will reach for that new glow

Even though I'm still a novice at the moment
We will have to keep going, that's the thing we're going to do in the future!!

We will not forget, we're sure we won't as long as we have dreams
There's someone we all want to become someday
We will not forget, never forget what it means to believe
Surely after tomorrow, I will be closer to my dreams

It will never stop, I'm sure it won't this warm throb
You and I will always be connected from this point onwards
It will never stop, I'm sure it won't get even more warm
Let's go on as our hands will reach for that new glow
