If I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will consult you

Which clothes would suit me better?
Would others see it the same way?
Furthermore I’m not sure of my own criteria
At times like those, you called me over, My friend

The answer is probably the two of us
Laughing off the doubts of our wavering hearts
I really, I really love you

Humming day What shall we do?
Humming day Anything is fine
For example, something even bigger? That's the feeling I have
Humming day A fun future
Humming day Going to search but
You're worried, so I held your hand with a nod


These dishonest feelings will surely
Be noticed one way or another
In the end, I can’t lie to myself
At times like those, you told me to be strong, my friend

I hid it but the truth is
You sensed my tearful feelings
I really, I really love you
...We may fight, but

Hello sky After the fight
Hello sky We became closer
We managed to apologize somehow without words
Hello sky A fun world
Hello sky Let's discover lots more
I want to make it interesting, Humming my friend

If I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will consult you


Humming day What shall we do?
Humming day Anything is fine
There are a lot of answers But also hesitation
Humming day What shall we do?
Humming day Anything is fine
For example, something even bigger? That's the feeling I have
Humming day A fun future
Humming day Going to search but
You're worried, so I held your hand with a nod

If I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will... consult you!
