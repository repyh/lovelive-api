Ah, it changes day by day
The clear blue sky that once was
Embraces our thoughts and feelings
Slowly tinting itself in the deep orange of sunset

The music resonates in our ears
After everyone has exhausted themselves running around
As the sun sets below the horizon
The silence of the world dawns upon us

The smile on your face when you're dancing with all you've got is just so dazzling
Let's be together forever, let's have fun together forever!

While resting the feathers of our hearts
We'll dream of tomorrow as we slumber
All I want is for us to continue having fun forever
Let's be sure to spread the feathers of our hearts wide once again
All I want is for us to continue having fun forever
Let's be sure to say that out loud, to the fading horizon

The silver stars trace out their paths
Upon the drapes of the night sky

We'll put all our wishes out on display
Carving all our memories deep into our hearts

Let's play together a whole lot, that's the promise I made with you
And we'll continue doing just that, even in the future!

The feathers of our hearts symbolize our hope
Guiding us forward as we awaken to a new day
We'll see you soon, that, we are sure of
The feathers of our hearts fly free, right after the morning sun's glow fades
We'll see you soon, that, we are sure of
The light of dawn shines bright at the horizon

What appears in my dreams as the feather in my heart rests
Has always been the time I'll spend with you tomorrow
I wonder why joy and sadness always come in pairs
I can't help but to wonder

The feathers of our hearts, may they fly towards you!

The feathers of our hearts symbolize our hope
Guiding us forward as we awaken to a new day
We'll see you soon, that, we are sure of
The feathers of our hearts fly free, right after the morning sun's glow fades
We'll see you soon, that, we are sure of
The light of dawn shines bright at the horizon
