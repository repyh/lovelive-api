I can't wait to see the smiles this year
Let's go search for presents in the city

When the door decorated with a silver ribbon opened
You were there--we had the same idea

We were found out (by each other) and start to laugh
Tell me what you want
I'm happy (I'm happy) we all get along
Sharing the happy feelings

Yeah! Happy Christmas!!

Because what's important is spending time with you always,
It's a promise, save some time for me
Gather your courage and call this out
I wish merry merry ChristmasÔºÅ
Now, call out everybody, don't you want to party?
Cheers to jingle bells!

It's a special day, shall we make a big cake?
A feeling that it'll be a failure, you can't speak of that!

Snow (it better fall) I get it, but
I hope for something romantic
Let's play (let's play) even if we make too much noise, since it's this day
We'll be forgiven

Yeah! Dancin' Christmas!!

Who is it that you want to see? If you want to be with them
Let's go invite them, we'll have fun dancing
We'll frolic around, while clinging to each other
I wish merry merry Christmas!
So, everyone's plans, I want to decide them on this night
The jingle bells won't stop
