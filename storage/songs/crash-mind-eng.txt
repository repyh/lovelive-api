Saint CRASH!!

Someone's scenario Dreaming future
No more trick, no more trap!
A not to be deceived Dreaming future
I don't need it Bye-bye

You're looking from a safe place
I know it
That arrogant smile makes you seem more adult like

CRASH MIND
The answers have appeared after the breakdown
CRASH MIND
Even if I cry and get lost I won't let it fail
No matter what happens to My trust

No more trick, no more trap!
No more trick, no more trap!

A glass treasure box, a toy's box that was important to me
I don't need it anymore, it's all in my heart
No more trick let's dream
No more trap from myself
It's not a trick (No!) It's not a trap (No!)
Dream comes true!! (Yes!!)

The meaning of experience
It's different for everyone
But old-hearted adults are liars

CRASH PLAN
For example, when will you want to break everything?
CRASH PLAN
Because I don't think scratching time is useless
It won't escape no matter what My heart

You're looking from a safe place
I know it
That arrogant smile makes you seem more adult like

CRASH MIND
The answers have appeared after the breakdown
CRASH MIND
Even if I cry and get lost I won't let it fail
CRASH PLAN
Break!
CRASH PLAN
Because I don't think scratching time is useless
It won't escape no matter what My heart

No more trick, no more trap!
No more trick, no more trap!
