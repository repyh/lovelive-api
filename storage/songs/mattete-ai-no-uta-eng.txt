I listened with, my eyes closed, to the repeating sound of the waves
Today is quietly flowing by

With no one to pass by, I walked on the street alone
Lalala... Humming the song of love

An emotion as strong as this one
I don't understand it yet, but someday
I want to try singing with my emotions from the bottom of my heart
(When will that day come?)

Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
Love is still a distant passion filled with mystery
Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
That's why I want to know more (There's much more I want to learn)
My aspirations (Watch me) chase after them

"I wonder if I can make an hourglass", that's what I thought as I stood by the sea
Always just rambling on pointlessly

The mood is just a bit sad if I stop and stand here alone
Lalala... The song of love makes me cry

If I try asking someone, will I understand?
It's not something I can comprehend by just asking, is it?
I want to try singing with my emotionsâ”€ with the power of love that scorches my heart
(But that's for the future)

Can you believe in me? That I'll surely be able to sing someday
This thing called love, just imagining it, it's my future mission
Can you believe in me? That I'll surely be able to sing someday
That's why without thinking about it, (Can I leave it to its own course?)
In the process (new encounters) might just happen


The sound of the song of love
Is both kind and sad, isn't it?
Why is it that I've never noticed?
Hey, my chest is starting to hurt
The scent of the song of love
Is more blue than the breeze of the sea
It's a scent I want to ascertain further
(A scent that is both blue and painful)

Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
Love is still a distant passion filled with mystery
Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
That's why I want to know more (There's much more I want to learn)
My aspirations (Watch me chase after them)
Aah, I'm humming the song of love... lalala...
