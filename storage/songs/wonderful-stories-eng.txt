We rushed toward our dreams
(Our) WONDERFUL STORIES
(Our radiant tale) lights up the night!
Our story shines!

We were always, always chasing
A future that seemed within reach but never was
That's why, that's why, I was able to meet you
Thanks for being with me

It was frustrating to feel like something was missing
I always wanted more
It was an adventure to find a special something
And when we arrived here, we finally found it!

In reality we had it all along
All of us had it within our hearts
A sleeping radiance, A power yet to awaken
We rushed toward our dreams
And our stories are
Melodies flowing from all our memories
I can hear a new dream
Let's go again, far away, DREAMING DAYS

Where, where does the answer lie?
No matter who you ask, you won't know, it's in the future
Each of us, each of us will eventually choose
Our own paths to walk, did you know this all along?

We encouraged each other with "It's OK if you can't do it"
And then, we did it!
Someday you won't be able to say things like "it's impossible"
With a "hey!", we did it!
We want to shine while we're living
With a heart that wishes for that, we found it!

Our brightest smiles!
Let's enjoy the day called today
Let's soar on the new trajectory drawn by our blue wings
The feelings that connect us
Will forever remain
We will never forget such a wonderful feeling
Now we're calling for a new dream
Let's meet again, someday, far away

We were looking for the blue bird
And we found it
But don't put it away in a cage
Let it fly freely, Yes!
The answer is always in my heart
When I realized, there was a light

That's right, in reality we had it all along
All of us had it within our hearts
A sleeping radiance, A power yet to awaken
We rushed toward our dreams
And our stories are
Melodies flowing from all our memories
I can hear a new dream
They'll start again someday, our next DREAMING DAYS
