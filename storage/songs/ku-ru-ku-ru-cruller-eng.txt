Yeah Aqours
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Let's go

Happy dance, happy dance
Round and around, happy dance
Happy dance, happy dance

Happy dance, happy dance
Round and around, happy dance
Happy dance, happy dance

The sky and the sea
Are always connected (with you)
We'll always be able to meet
Inside of your heart

Now, if you close your eyes
Our stage will appear: Let's dance with me
In the world that we jumped into,
Our dreams will spin round and round!

What'll happen?
As long as we have a blast, it'll be alright!
We'll make you happy in this new way
I know that we feel the same
I always know
I understand what your feelings are

I want to always be with you
There's a place that connects me to you
From your heart to mine,
Our connected sounds won't be erased

I believe it'll be conveyed to you
My love will be conveyed (my love!)

Singing to the sky,
And talking to the sea (even now)
I'll always be listening
To what you're saying (Hey!)

Yes, it doesn't end when you open your eyes
Our stage is an endless passion
In these overlapping worlds,
Our dreams will spin round and round!

What'll happen?
I want to play with you forever and ever
Hearing your voice makes me feel happy
We feel the same way
I understand what your wishing for
I understand what your feelings are
