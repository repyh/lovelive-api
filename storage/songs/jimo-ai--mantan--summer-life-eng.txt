I wonder what kind of summer lies in store for us
On the edge of this sea that stretches out for miles?
One day I'll like to find out, though I already have a feeling
That we'll have the most fun right here

It's not special or anything, but this sea
Has always watched over us
And this old beach knows
Our joys and our sadness

The morning is still cold
And our feet are freezing
In the water fish brush by our feet
This is kind of fun

Let's spend our summer here together
The voice of the waves rolling on the shore gives the feeling of vacation
I want to hear it together, it's so refreshing, right?
We have to take a break sometimes

Let's have a chat
While crunching the sand beneath our feet
Our summer life in our very own home town

I had a small yearning
For a walk while holding a white parasol
Let's walk, not minding our sunburns
On our beach that's number one!

I want to make the beauty of the sunset into a postcard
I'm fascinated by the changing gradations
So pretty, and heartrending

Let's spend next summer here together too
When you can't think of a place you want to go
Come over here! A summer not doing anything is fine too, right?
Before the heat makes our heads dizzy

Let's spend our summer here together
The voice of the waves rolling on the shore gives the feeling of vacation
I want to hear it together, it's so refreshing, right?
We have to take a break sometimes

Let's have a chat
While crunching the sand beneath our feet
Our summer life in our very own home town
The sky is sparkling
Even if I close my eyes, the shore that I love is dazzling
Our local love filled summer life
