Perhaps the real me was born
On a place not on Earth
I've always been lonely, where is the one
That understands my heart?
Ah, in this maze, I'm all alone!

"I'm here!" I can hear someone's voice say
Please, guide me with that gentle voice!
With just that, it seems like
I can come to really like this planet.
Let's hurry and meet each other,
I'm calling calling you!

That person is also on a trip searching for me
How is it that I know that?
I have to find you, the one who understands my heart
Are you waiting for me?
The exit...is it close?

If you could tell me with telepathy where you are now
We'll be connected, and it will the start of a miracle
From then on I can make more and more
Wonderful memories on this planet
So let's meet each other

The world is wide, but it's fate that we will definitely draw each other
It's like we're playing hide-and-seek
Please don't say "not yet!"

Is this the last step? The person
That understands my heart is waiting
That someone is... you!

"I'm here!" I can hear your voice say
Please, guide me with your gentle voice!
With just that, it seems like
I can come to really like this planet.
Let's hurry and meet each other,
I'm calling calling you!
