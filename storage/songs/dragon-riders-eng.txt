I was thinking about where to go when I hopped on board
This dragon's back feels really nice
Go forth! Go forth! Into the clear sky
Let's fly to the ends of the world

There's so much I want to see. I want to see it with my own eyes.
I want to hear what everyone's wishes are
I want to cuddle you and be there for you too. I'm always thinking about you

Neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there
Okay, I'll wait. Okay, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? We can do something! We're friends, afterall
Let's play over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
It's all right, I'll wait for you. It's all right, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? We can do something!
C'mon, I'm coming to meet you all!!

I just wandered down here, and now I don't know where I am
There's a dragon winking down at this blue Earth
Danger! Danger! Everyone, do your best!
Let's make the world a fun place

Whether it's a big town, or a small island
If we all smile, our dreams will come true
When our hearts touch, we'll feel energized and revitalized

Not saying a single word, not even humming or acting like a cat or dog
Okay, I'll wait. Okay, I'm sure it'll work out.
Let me hear your voice overlap with mine
We'll dance over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
It's all right, I'll wait for you. It's all right, I'm sure it'll work out.
We'll sing about these dreams to the whole world

Neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there
Okay, I'll wait. Okay, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? We can do something! We're friends, afterall
Let's play over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
It's all right, I'll wait for you. It's all right, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? We can do something!
C'mon, I'm coming to meet you all!!
