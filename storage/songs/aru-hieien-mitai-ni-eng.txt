One day... what would you do if the stairs of the sea
Appeared at the end of the waves? Would you like to go together?
Mermaids call you
Overlapping with a world of blue dreams

The scenery turns into a myth
While Neptune holds out its hand
And the fish with pearl-colored lace dance
Mermaids will call you
Let our thoughts dive in and swim

What's going to happen?
What's going to happen?

I'll close my eyes, and when I open them
The sky, the sea, and the sun will shine like eternity
Oh, how beautiful!
I'll breathe in the air that I love so much
Who I am in this place?
What time period am I in?
Hey, you there, let's find an answer!

Even today... when the wind blows, the ocean stairs appear
Your thoughts will soon go on an adventure
Wake up kingdom
This is not an illusion, this is a world of blue dreams

When a story is born,
Surely dream fragments will be found and put together
Oh, how wonderful!
I want to savor every second of it, because it's my favorite place
You and I are here, and we're living in the moment

A blue world, a dream world
It'll keep restarting
What's going to happen?
What's going to happen?

When a story is born,
Surely dream fragments will be found and put together
Oh, how wonderful!
I want to savor every second of it, because it's my favorite place
You and I are here, and we're living in the moment

One day... it'll feel like forever!
