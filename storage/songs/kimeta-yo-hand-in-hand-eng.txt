Hand in Hand, wow wo! Hand in Hand, wow wo!

What am I looking for?
I still don’t know, but I think the entrance is here (Hand in Hand)
The sleeping passion inside you
It’s going to awake soon… I feel it! (Hand in Hand)

The premonition that gives birth to the dream
Shouldn’t be a mere illusion (wow wo!)
It won’t start until you move
I want to grab hold of that hand

Change, Change, from today to a new world
Change, Change, I’ll try to push you forward with energy
If we’re together, maybe we will fly
I won’t hesitate or give up anymore
I’ve decided! Where will we go from now on?
Let’s go, hand in hand!

Who are we going to reunite with?
Maybe it’s not the right time (Hand in Hand)
I want to believe in my intuition, my heart shivers as I end up wanting to call out

If you don’t want your dreams to be shapeless
You’re not alone (wow wo!)
You’ll end up wanting companions
Who also want to act, like you

“Come over, come over,” I know it’s an unreasonable request, but I must invite you still
“Come over, come over,” If you get your courage out, you can probably do it
I want to fly somewhere together
So, give me your hand, and let’s go!

Hand in Hand, wow wo!

The premonition that gives birth to the dream
Shouldn’t be a mere illusion, wow wo!

Change, Change, from today to a new world
Change, Change, I’ll try to push you forward with energy
“Come over, come over,” I know it’s an unreasonable request, but I must invite you still
“Come over, come over,” If you get your courage out, you can probably do it
If we’re together, maybe we will fly
I won’t hesitate or give up anymore
I’ve decided! Where will we go from now on?
Let’s go, hand in hand!

Hand in Hand, wow wo! Hand in Hand, wow wo!
