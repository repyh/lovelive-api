Let's become light as I want to shine in the future
This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart

Even the dreams that had made me cry
Came true because I didn't give up
We all suffered in order to make it here, right?
We're just getting started so I won't falter anymore

Hold your aspirations close for your next task
There'll be a new world just for us (I know it's there)
We say "Aye Aye"

The ship's leaving, so let's sail for the future
The blue sky is smiling (What do you want to do?)
Let's become light as I want to shine in the future
This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart and I see more of the sights ahead

Let's become light as I want to shine in the future
I won't fail anymore

The ship's leaving, so let's set sail for the future
The blue sky is smiling (What do you want to do?)
Let's become light as I want to shine in the future
This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart and I see more of the sights ahead
Ah! Hold up your tickets to the future we've earned...!
