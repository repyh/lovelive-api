"I can't be loved by anyone"
Don't say that, even if you want to

Hey, surely we're really similar
So don't close off your heart
Hey, surely our feelings are the same
(I want to love only one)
Just one love is enough

Till that time, I'll shut myself away
In the inside of a small egg

Open eyes! Before long I'll wake up
And soon, I'll break open this shell
Open eyes! Though I'm cowardly, I want to fly
But I'm trembling in my innocence

Love me, say yes? Say yes!

Feelings without substance change me (So)
Is this what passion is?
It doesn't happen many times, right? Only once
After all, that's what fate is.

But until then, we shut ourselves away
You're also inside an egg, aren't you?

Open heart! My chest aches with a throbbing pain
How can I unfurl these wet wings?
Open heart! I want to love, and to be loved
But I'm afraid and innocent

Love me do!

It shouldn't be many times Love me do!
Open heart! My chest aches with a throbbing pain
How can I unfurl these wet wings?
Open heart! I want to love, and to be loved
True love happens only once, says my innocence

Love me! Say yes!
