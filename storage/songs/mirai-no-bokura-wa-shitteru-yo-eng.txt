Let's throw our all at each other and grab hold of the future!

The sky and this ocean are both on our side
Shining and saying, "Go do your best!"
To let our voices reach far, far away
Shall we shout our dreams even louder?

(Full of hope)
Today pulls tomorrow toward itself
It's really fun to grasp the magnet in my heart and run right now
(Let's always go together!)

What shall we do about the future!?
As they look for the shape of their dreams, everyone laughs and cries
Because I'm sure the future us will have the answer
Let's run with everything we have

While singing and getting wet by the rain
I believe the sky will definitely clear
Let's try calling out with a cheerful, cheerful voice
And we'll surely meet our big dreams

I want to grow, and so one by one
I'll overcome my inabilities
In the midst of waves of clouds, a new blue sky is waiting, waiting for us

Let's fly off with high expectations!!
I want to go, With this kind of vigor, whether I cry or laugh
Our expectations are giving us lots of signals
So don't run away, catch hold of this chance!

I live, I live Love Live! days!!
If we throw our all in, won't it come true, this... dream?

What shall we do about the future? The shape of their dreams
Ah Everyone is looking for it, everyone!
Let's fly off with high expectations!!
I want to go, with this kind of vigor, whether I cry or laugh
Because I'm sure the future us will have the answer
Let's run with everything we have, and catch hold of this chance!

Let's become the shining wind
We got dream!
