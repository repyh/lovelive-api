I know I won't ever be alone in my dreams Go!!
Whenever you ready? Go!

Finally you've started to see?
That light that will never disappear within you (That's right!)
No matter where you go because, those wings that you have that are called hope so Fly high

If you ask to be given strength
Be prepared to accept also weakness (My fault!)
We have no time to waste, Our dreams may escape our reach
So, it's time to be reborn!

Let's turn into something new, push away our old selfs, let's keep on
Can't we? Yes we can! Let's dash to a new place!
I want to dance some more

Believe again
While I hold tightly to everything I have
Believe again

This is serious, I want to tell you this thing I want to do
No matter when with this passion we sure will be free
Believe again
Everything will start again (Yeah) Yeah!! (Yeah)
Ah, this adventure won't stop Let's go!

No matter how fun is in here
It won't be forever so it's time for us to go (Time over)
Doesn't matter wherever we go because this warm memories will rest in my heart My life!

It was to heavy to take off and fly
So it threw away it's heart in an attempt to soar (Step out!)
Change is something we'll have to accept, let's evolve for the sake of our dreams
Well, now I get it!

Looking forward all the time, doing everything you want me to do, let's keep on
Can't we? Yes we can! Go ahead firmly and dash!

Looking forward holding their dreams towards the future
