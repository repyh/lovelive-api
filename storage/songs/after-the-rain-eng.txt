The stars fade away in the quiet morning sky
In their place, a feeling of hope rises from the east

Things didn't go well yesterday, but that's all in the past
I've changed since then

I believe you should always stand strong
Even after the nights when it rains
Because the glow of the sun the next morning will illuminate your heart
And dry your tears away
I'm giving things my all right now, I don't want to give up on that
I want to try all sorts of new things
After all, time just keeps on flowing,
And no one can stop that

The moon in the morning sky is beautiful, isn't it?
My worries are swept away by the singing of birds

Yesterday was painful, but that's all in the past
I've gotten over it since then

If you believe, you can always stand strong
And not think you can't do anything
With the light of a new morning,
Comes the feeling you'll be able to smile again

I believe you should always stand strong
Even after the nights when it rains
Because the glow of the sun the next morning will illuminate your heart
And dry your tears away
I'm giving things my all right now, I don't want to give up on that
I want to try all sorts of new things
After all, time just keeps on flowing,
And no one can stop that
