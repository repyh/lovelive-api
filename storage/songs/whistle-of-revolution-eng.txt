The whistle that will signal the beginning will be blown soon
In a split second, my heart's switch turns on: I'm getting fired up
Now, advance towards a evolution
Look at this revolution!
I won't be stopped

I'm getting a lot of support for running, running, running
Everyone is gradually getting faster as they run towards the future
I've decided this is my evolution
Come over here, revolution!
I won't be stopped; I can't be stopped

What do you like to dream about? We met to make them come true
They're going to spread far and wide
And even if I laugh out loud, we'll all be laughing in the end!

Stop worrying so much about it being all over
It'll be great if you could go from "no" to "yes" in 0.2 seconds
Ah, full throttle to a evolution
This is our revolution!
I won't be stopped; I can't be stopped

Surely we met to play together
After all, it would be a lot of fun
The world will always continue to change

I've decided this is my evolution
Come over here, revolution!
I won't be stopped; I can't be stopped

What do you like to dream about? We met to make them come true
They're going to spread far and wide
I won't be upset if you laugh out loud
Because the world will always continue to change, we'll all be laughing in the end!
