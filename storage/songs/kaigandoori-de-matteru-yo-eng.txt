I was waiting for you on the coastal street, but today you just wouldn't show up
I was waiting for you on the coastal street, but your car kept on going past me

I don't know which of us started this first
But on this street (that we always) go home on, we were both put in a bad mood

When you think about it, we got distant over such stupid things
With those accidentally strong (and harsh) words, we've started an angry competition

But still
I'd really thought you'd understand me

I was waiting for you on the coastal street, but today you just wouldn't show up

I'm so anxious about tomorrow, when we have to see each other
I don't have any confidence that I'll be able (to smile) at you normally
I'll probably have to act from now on that it was only coincidence
That I (casually) walk over to you just to see how things are going...
I hate this
These salty feelings of mine are getting me down
Ugh, I hate this!

As I walk, the sea and the wind become orange-coloured
My selfish thoughts begin to shine, and give me motivation

So, I'm telling you
I'm waiting for you on the coastal street, I shout it out to the sunset
I'm waiting for you on the coastal street, I want you to know I'm still waiting!
This costal street (we always use) is the seaside of our friendship (so)
I really want you to come today
Will you come? Will you not? Won't you? Please come!
