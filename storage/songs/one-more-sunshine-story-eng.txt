What's going to happen from now on?
A dream is knock-knocking against my chest
If I dash off towards it, I feel like it'll come true

In the next world
My dance with you will begin
A passionate harmony of premonitions and expectations

My wish to shine, has one day
Grown even bigger
"I want a special radiance!"

One More Story, a brand new story
When I'm chasing it,
Aah, I can't stop smiling
One More Story, a fresh new story
Who is waiting for me?
Aah, I want to feel my heart race
So c'mon, let's go!

Heading towards an unfamiliar road
My next steps are calling
Let's be more greedy
And dream, shall we?

Because I was shone on, I want to try shining
Even it's still a small light
It should still reach someone!

Sunshine Story, a story in our hearts
If we gather up all these encounters
Ah, our hopes will widen as well
Sunshine Story, a story in your heart
No two stories are the same!
Ah, if you want to sparkle
Then, let's go!

It's surely, surely something greater than you can imagine
(Something's going to happen from here on out)
And so, and so, have you resolved yourself?
(Believe in your own power)
The future I want to make certain of
Because I can't see it, my heart is throbbingã€€Yes!!

One More Story, a brand new story
When I'm chasing it,
Aah, I can't stop smiling
One More Story, a fresh new story
Who is waiting for me?
Aah, I want to feel my heart race
So c'mon, let's go!
