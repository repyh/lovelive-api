Common sense? What’s that mean??
This is a huge universe!
By sitting idle and counting the stars, countless chances to kick-start love will disappear

When people who live life truly alive
Feel that they like someone
Everything else becomes a second thought, so

Things like, “Who are you?”—ah, I won’t ask that
My heart is lightning-struck with a love at first sight that goes “Brrrrrrrrrzt!”

Once you think it’s fate,
There’s no hesitation, right? So, get my love!!
Getting closer, getting ever-so-hot—
What comes after that… well, I don’t know yet
(I don't care!)
While I still don’t know, (Just leave it!)
Is getting closer a sweet trap? Love Pulsar!

It’s orthodox, isn’t it?! We’ve already had too much of that!!
In this vast universe,
Wishing for a love too steady—that’s as boring as it can get

Where there’s a will, there’s a way—give it a try!
This love is my top priority
Everything else will work itself out somehow

Right now, I want to be, ah, right by your side
Thunder strikes my body, pounding like, “Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump!”

Say it with all your heart—you’re being unfair
Are you holding your tongue and running away? So, get my love!!
This chest that’s begun to hurt,
I want to show it more to you, I want you to show me… see, it won’t stop
While it hasn’t stopped,
I’ll fly with you into the cosmos. Love Pulsar!

Once you think it’s fate,
There’s no hesitation, right? So, get my love!!
Getting closer, getting ever-so-hot—
What comes after that…

Say it with all your heart—you’re being unfair
Are you holding your tongue and running away? So, get my love!!
This chest that’s begun to hurt,
I want to show it more to you, I want you to show me… see, it won’t stop
While it hasn’t stopped,
I’ll fly with you into the cosmos. Love Pulsar!
