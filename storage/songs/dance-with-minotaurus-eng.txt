Fight oh! Fight oh! I'll save you, Hi!
Fight oh! Fight oh! I'll save you

But, what is this!?
I'll never forgive whoever made you cry
What happened? I want you to tell me!

Inside a big labyrinth it feel like your voice's about to disappear
No, no, no! Come on, shout even more!
The Minotaurus told me; "I'm worried," it said
If I don't find you soon, you'll be in trouble!

Let all your worries go flying over over over there!
Because we're all definitely definitely definitely your allies
We'll listen to anything you have to say, so
Please don't run and hide in such a dark and scary place—hey, come over here!

But, what is this!?
I'll never forgive whoever made you cry

I threw my hands to this mysterious hall, walking along one of its walls
Where can it be? Maybe I'm getting close
This Minotaurus isn't a foe, do not believe any chit-chat
Truths・Lies are always difficult to judge!

Put a smile on your face and forget it all
Let it to us the job of hug your worries away
We will wipe your tears, so
Please don't be sad all on your own—you can see us, right? Come over here!

Well there it is!
It seems that we made it, there's the exit we'll take you with us
Whatever that will happen, we promise we'll take you there
(Fight oh! Fight oh! I'll save you, Hi!)
Do you feel relieved? Want to let it out?
Then let's dance, let's do it together
The sweat might just chase it all away
(Fight oh! Fight oh! I'll save you)
Turning and spinning all around!

Let all your worries go flying over over over there!
