The road we're on always seems long
But is actually short. It's because we met,
That we have what we have now

The 9 of us stand on stage,
But everyone here feels like the 10th member
That's what we have now

I learned the joy of having our hearts connected
You've supported me so much
I'm really going to cry

I can't say enough how thankful I am
I'll throw my whole body into it, you're our friend too!

Nothing stays the same
Somehow I get that
But surely, this passion won't ever change

Can we keep chasing our dreams forever?
Because you gave me a nod
I really love you

Ah, please don't ever forget, that we were all here
Let's make countless memories
And once again, reach our hands out to the light

I can't say enough how thankful I am
I'll throw my whole body into it, you're our friend too!
The 10th member is you, you're our friend too!

The 10th member is you, you're our friend too!

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!
