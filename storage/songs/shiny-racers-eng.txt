Even without being told by anyone, I know
I have to go to somewhere, to search for a new place

When I want to protect others,
Rather than being protected like usual, is that when I draw closer to my dream?

Shiny Racer; I want to chase after
The light that my heart desires, I don't want to let it escape

You feel you can be even freer?
O.K. let's go, let's go to what lies ahead
I want to seize it even more,
I want to live, while gathering the 'shine' from all over the world

If I lose sight of my wish
I'll quietly close my eyes, and follow the thread of my heart

If I return to
The scenery that I once loved, my dream will be resurrected

Burning Racer; It doesn't matter where, I'll run
Even if this road crumbles, I'll make another

You think I should stay this fired up forever?
O.K. let's go, let's go to our own goals!
I've always wanted to break loose,
I'll continue living, searching for the 'shine' all over the world

Yeah, sing-along!
We live as "Shiny Racers"
I sing a song that my heart, burning heart
Yeah, sing-along!
We live as "Shiny Racers"
Toward the shine... Toward the shine... !

You feel you can be even freer?
O.K. let's go, let's go to what lies ahead
I want to seize it even more,
I want to live, while gathering the 'shine' from all over the world
