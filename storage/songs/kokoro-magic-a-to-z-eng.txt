Now it’s everyday without anything (but hey)
If we get even a single chance (guess what)
No matter what, we’ll all be making an amazing change (really)

We’re attracted to it, we want to touch it
Let’s all find the meaning of our encounter together

So let’s start our Magic (Magic)
Everyone’s Magic (Magic)
All the passion in your heart wants to be awakened within
So let’s start our Magic (Magic)
Everyone’s Magic (Magic)
Dreaming from "A to Z", so let’s have fun starting from "A to Z"

Because it seems there's nothing here (Surely)
There may be a lot inside your heart (There is!)
There's a seed that will spurt excitement

I want some courage to give a step (Yes, right?)
My body you can say it's more than set (That's it!)
To fly, to fly away full of resolution (Let's go)

If you get to find it, try to reach it
I finally found it hidden deep inside you heart!

It's a shining Magic (Magic!)
An everlasting Magic (Magic!)
Since I am trying so hard to grasp on this unexpected future
It's a shining Magic (Magic!)
An everlasting Magic (Magic!)
If you wish on A to Z, it may will make itself real A to Z

I want to know more, let's try asking for that
Because, that's the only thing I don't know so I'm set that from now...!

Let’s start our Magic (Magic)
Everyone’s Magic (Magic)
All the passion in your heart wants to be awakened within
So let’s start our Magic (Magic)
Everyone’s Magic (Magic)
Dreaming from "A to Z", so let’s have fun starting from "A to Z"
Heart Magic oh yeah!!
