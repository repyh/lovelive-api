Even when the cold wind blows
Even when the freezing rain falls
I won't let go of your hand again
I won't let go of you again

What's on your mind?
I want to properly talk it out with you
As I run outside,
My breath is white and shaky

I want to say it
I really do
But I don't want to worry you either
Even if I choke on my words,
My tears convey them instead

Hey, isn't it weird?
We've somehow grown distant
And lost sight of each other

The simple truth, the honest truth
Is that I always want to be with you
These feelings will never change
I want to tell you right away. I want to tell you

I want to tell you because it's important
But since it's too important, I can't tell you
Either way, it's frustrating
But even so, I just want to know
Please tell me everything

Let's not do this again!
Stop pretending that you don't care
Because our hearts have been connected since we first met

Even when the cold wind blows
Even when the freezing rain falls
I won't let go of your hand again
I definitely won't let go. I won't let go of you again

I had planned to hug you then
But now with my arms stretched out... I can reach you!
You're reaching out to me, and we're laughing now

The simple truth, the honest truth
Is that I always want to be with you
These feelings will never change
I want to tell you right away

The cold wind and the freezing rain
Our tears have turned to snow
Once I hold you in my arms, I won't let go
I'll never let you go again
As the white snow falls down onto our shoulders
