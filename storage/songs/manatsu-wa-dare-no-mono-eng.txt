I dance in a dress of the red sun
Are you staring at me?
I want to avert my eyes, yet I can’t avert them
Ah, I want to burn with passion

This evening, I find myself longing to know of a rhythm that’s more than exciting
I whisper to you words braver than usual
“Even though they’re my own feelings,
I don’t want to understand all of them”
It’s a command that reason can’t touch; my control becomes unpredictable

Did my voice, longing to know of that kind of love, end up reaching you?
Even if I think it’s shameful,
I want to know more, I want to know more
As I start to realise it’s a forbidden dream…

I dance in a dress of the red sun
From your eyes, staring at me,
I want to avert my own eyes, yet I can’t avert them
Who does midsummer belong to?
I want it to become something that belongs to the both of us
Seeing as, in this season where our hearts can’t stop pounding,
It seems like the door to my heart has opened for the first time
You knock, knock my heart!!

As my hesitant steps start to turn feverish,
These impulses that shouldn’t normally exist confuse me
If your hand and my hand are intertwined, will something begin?

The fireworks illuminate your profile
I had a premonition that this day would surely come, you see
I can no longer go back; I don’t want to go back
I’ve been lured in by this midsummer
I want this summer to become ours,
Seeing as it’s a season where our hearts can’t stop pounding
With a sweet, yet sad scent, I suddenly feel like I’m about to cry

As our dance brings us closer, then farther apart, my head becomes numb
Come over here; come over here
Now, I’m not scared anymore, of anything at all

I dance in a dress of the red sun
From your eyes, staring at me,
I want to avert my own eyes, yet I can’t avert them
Who does midsummer belong to?
I want it to become something that belongs to the both of us
Seeing as our hearts can’t stop pounding in this season
For the first time, it seems like the door to my heart has opened
You knock, knock my heart!!

Ah, hold me tight in a passionate embrace!
