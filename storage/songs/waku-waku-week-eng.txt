This week's Waku-Waku (Have you decided?)
Hey, hey, hey, tell me (I want to hear!)
Full of Waku-Waku (What is it?)
Now announce it? OK!!

There will be times we fail, but don't worry about that and count our successes
Maybe there's nothing to count
If we have more experience, maybe we'll become respectable?
Only one way to find out!
Let's learn from our mistakes and go

Marked with energy (an energy stamp!), your friends are right here (right here!)
A downhearted face?? Bye-bye!! Bye-b-bye!
Smile! Don't be nervous, ah, everyone's having fun
We're progressing with happy smiles!

Once we count our beginnings
What comes after that? I want to see with you
Once we count our beginnings
What comes after that might be even more dreams
...But I don't know


This week we're Waku-Waku
Yeah, yeah, yeah, our plan is
lots of Waku-Waku
Okay, let's go on an adventure!

My delusions are unstoppable - then, I won't stop them
I'll draw out a pleasant future as far as my heart desires
How is it actually? Am I only half a step into life?
Only one way to find out!
Let's be unrealistic and go

Cheerful and proud (Cheerful fire!), your friends are always here (always here!)
A tired mind?? Bye-bye!! Bye-b-bye!
Dance! Let's have fun, ah, since everyone's together
Let's transform with a happy dance!

Where did it all begin?
There were a lot of events, like meeting you
Where did it all begin?
With all those events, our thoughts grew closer
...I'm happy


Marked with energy (an energy stamp!), your friends are right here (right here!)
A downhearted face?? Bye-bye!! Bye-b-bye!
Smile! Don't be nervous, ah, everyone's having fun
Aye aye sir! Waku-Waku-Week, Come on!!

Once we count our beginnings
What comes after that? I want to see with you
Once we count our beginnings
What comes after that might be even more dreams, oh yeah!
Where did it all begin?
There were a lot of events, like meeting you
Where did it all begin, I wonder?
With all those events, our thoughts grew closer
...It almost makes me happy!
