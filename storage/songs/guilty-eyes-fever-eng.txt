Fall in love with my Guilty Eyes
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever
I won’t give it to anyone; this
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever

You can’t decide yes or no clearly
Laughing while hiding your intentions is your bad habit
If you don’t choose everyone will disappear
(Everyone, everyone) They will disappear

There's no shame in being greedy
As long as it’s not a lie, I’ll accept it
Please confess with no worries
Just come at me (More, more)
I want to know it

My Guilty Eyes have always been aiming at you
And I want to capture all of your existence
You are my love

You can’t run away!
Shutdown to a world with only two of us
There’s no need for anyone else
I want you to try saying that you love me
I’m honest; Look into my eyes
(love with Fever)
I'll have you love me deeply (Guilty Fever)

My own heart is getting excited,
Admit it, your fire's been lit and
There's surely a reward waiting for good children!
(I'll give you, give you) A sweet kiss

You wanted to experience true love, right?
Say goodbye to indecisiveness!
Throw it to me;
The invitation to your heart
(Become, become) A scorching hot love

In what sort of dream do you want to embrace?
It's because it's you that I tremble with hesitation
(love me love you)
I want to touch you now!

up down We'll shine bright together in this chaos
Finally joining as one Guilty soul
Because I love you, watch me
Open the door to passion
No matter what may come (love with secret)
I want to confirm it (Guilty secret)

What sort of dream should we have?
One from which we'll never wake up
I want to know more
About you, about you
And then, I'll capture you!
you are my love

You can't run away!
Shutdown to a world with only two of us
There’s no need for anyone else
I want you to say that you love me
I'm honest!
Look into my eyes (love with fever)
I'll have you love me deeply (Guilty fever)
No matter what may come (love with secret)
I want to confirm it (Guilty secret)
