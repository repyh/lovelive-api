People aren't limited to only one existence
white wing black wing
A different me from yesterday gives a different answer today
If no is yes, then yes is no? It all depends on my mood
Ah, I'm certain there's more "me's" that I have yet to know

To cross this boring world
We have to combine our powers
Look, if it's me and you and "me", a miracle will soon happen!
But right now we have to bear with it, we have to bide our time in this unstable world


People believe that they are people through memories
good deed bad deed
I hate that my true form is different from everyone else's
"Go" means "go", not "stop", if you take the plunge without hesitation
You'll fly on nonstop, so take the plunge without hesitation
Ah, I've truly understood the real me

Do you still dream of the sacred world?
Beauty is something fragile
Maybe you and "you" and all of us can no longer remain innocent

Do you dream of the sacred world?
Do you want white wings upon your back?
But you and "you" and all of us can no longer remain innocent

To cross this boring world
We have to combine our powers
Look if it's me and you and "me", a miracle will soon happen!
But right now we have to bear with it, we have to bide our time and wait for our chance
Someday, somewhere, you and I are bound to meet in this unstable world
