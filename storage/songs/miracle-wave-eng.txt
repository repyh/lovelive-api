We'll push our limits until the end
(How'll it turn out? Heart-pounding WAVE)
It's time to overcome our impatient selves
(That's right! Go beyond the WAVE!!)
We can't think of anything else
(How'll it turn out? Heart-pounding WAVE)
Our dreams that have become one, run on
(That's right! Can't stop the WAVE!!)

So frustrated, we can't sit still anymore
I'm sure everyone understands that feeling

Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
My heart is crying out (the shine it craves)
I'll show you right in front of me
Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
That's the only choice (we decided) with super passionate jumps
Can we grab hold of a new light?
Let's believe (YEAH!)
That a MIRACLE WAVE can bring about miracles

Instead of fretting, just do it, go with a bang!
(It takes guts! An explosive WAVE)
Show me your results, when things change
(That's right! WAVE!! Things have changed)
Were we so naive back then?
(It takes guts! An explosive WAVE)
Our dreams that have become one, run on
(That's right! WAVE!! With lots of power!)

I want to stretch out my hand
With vigor, towards far away
We're all together through thick and thin

Will it come true? (HI!) It will! (HI!)
My wish is the same (My own radiance)
It's not a copy, it's an original HEART WAVE
Will it come true? (HI!) It will! (HI!)
It has to (and so) with super passionate jumps
We'll try to grasp a new light
The biggest (YEAH!) HEART WAVE MIRACLE

Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
My heart crying out (the shine it craves)
I'll show you right in front of me
Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
That's the only choice (we decided) with super passionate jumps
Can we grab hold of a new light?
Let's believe we can (YEAH!)
It's our biggest MIRACLE WAVE
A MIRACLE WAVE is calling forth a miracle
