There's no one who doesn't worry
In the water, the sunlight wavers
Even if you try to catch it
The light spills out of your hands

The seagulls fly off to the cape, it's a picture perfect, marine colored scene
They quietly melt into the sky, this must be what freedom is

Parasol, the road on the beach will always be the same
But the color of our dreams, we realized it'll change
Parasol, let's play and have fun
Saying see you later, we head towards the next season
Where we'll meet again, the sea breeze knows

Holding our sandals in hand,
When we step onto the cold sand,
The burning hot sun
Felt nostalgic

Even so, we can feel it, this isn't the end
The summer will come again, a different summer

Parallel, I'm glad for who we are now
If we had chosen any differently
We might not be smiling here together
Parallel, the talks of "if's"
Was swept away by the waves
Whether we'll meet again, the sea breeze knows

That horizon line, you want to see it again, don't you?
We ran through the hot summer

Even so, we can feel it, this isn't the end
The summer will come again, a different summer

Parasol, the road on the beach will always be the same
But the color of our dreams, we realized it'll change
Parasol, let's play and have fun
Saying see you later, we head towards the next season
Where we'll meet again, only the sea breeze knows
