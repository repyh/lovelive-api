Can we throw a Christmas Party (Party)
Just like the ones you'd see in children's books?
Somehow, even just prepping for it is fun (Party)
Especially when we talk about many things

Hey, is there someone on your mind?
I just want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets

Honestly... I don't care how we do it,
I just want to collect many things!
Like snow, cherry blossoms, fireworks, and the full moon!
Ah! We could do anything (anything!)
Party! Party! PaPaPaParty!
I really wanna be with you
No matter what season it is!
Let's get together to make some noise
I want you to blurt out all the things
You want to say without regrets
Because we're friends after all!

Let's decorate the window with gold braids (Party)
And have some fun as we prepare for this Christmas Party
Gently place the gift under the tree (Party)
So we can go back to talking about many things

I can't stop laughing
To the point that I need some water!
But once our eyes meet again,
I can't help but laugh hysterically over the same story!

I hope this will be a never-ending party
If we're in the mood to dance,
Then our bodies will want to dance even more
Ah! Let's twirl without a care (let's twirl!)
Party! Party! PaPaPaParty!
C'mon, let's dance
I can't sit still any longer
Let's make some noise while we dance
I want you to do all the things
You want to do without regrets
It'll be fine because we're friends!

After laughing so much,
Today will become only a memory
Will I be able to remember it whenever I want?
Only time will tell
But for now, I hear a little bell ringing inside of me
Party, ah Christmas Party!!

I honestly... don't care how we do it,
I just want to collect many things!
Like snow, cherry blossoms, fireworks, and the full moon!
Ah! We could do anything (anything!)
Party! Party! PaPaPaParty!
I really wanna be with you
No matter what season it is!
Let's get together to make some noise
I want you to blurt out all the things
You want to say without regrets
Because we're friends after all!
