I promise I won't laugh!
Isn't it fine the way it is?
I don't really mind even if it is weird at first
What's important is you'll "like" every day!

Sailing together! Beginner's Sailing! Everyone's sailing too!

Could I be lost right now?
It's not gonna work even if I want to do it
Let's change that train of thought
The heart knows how to emit courage

I mean, tomorrow morning
I can say the me of yesterday worked really hard
Originally I was no good but once I moved my body
Failure? Well that's the first step!

Dreams aren't always clear
And you're shining with hesitation,
So first of all, we gotta sail straight into the wind
C'mon let's learn how to sail with ease
I promise I won't laugh!
It's okay to have this feeling, right?
If we can do nothing at first,
What's important is your passion will become something you "love"!

Sailing together! Beginner's Sailing! Everyone's sailing too!

You still don't believe me?
With just your strength alone, we can get there faster

It can lead to plenty of possibilities
Like something exciting that even you can't imagine
Let's just start the engine instead of worrying
Mistakes are what make me stronger
A plan? Let's leave that aside and take a step!

I say straight to your face
To make that dream sparkle
As far out in the distant blue sky is
A bright dream that may not be finding its way

Sailing now!
I still don't know where I plan on going

I say straight to your face
To make that dream sparkle

Dreams aren't always clear
And you're shining with hesitation,
So first of all, we gotta sail straight into the wind
C'mon let's learn how to sail with ease
I promise I won't laugh!
It's okay to have this feeling, right?
If we can do nothing at first,
What's important is your passion will become something you "love"!

Sailing together! Beginner's Sailing!
(Come, let's go together!)
Everyone's sailing too! Beginner's Sailing!
Ah, let's dream
Sailing together! Beginner's Sailing!
Ah... Everyone's sailing too!
