In a cocoon, where no one's voice can even reach
Your heart's been dormant, closed off to the world for the longest time
Are you okay with that?
I'm not, I want you to open your eyes
Tell me, where is your cocoon slumbering?

From the depths of the sea, I heard a sigh
A lonely and miserable sigh
I want to locate your soul's cry of S.O.S
("Please find me!")
I've noticed your plea for help

This is almost like destiny; it's getting intense
I'll hold my breath, and dive into the black waters
Searching for traces of your presence

With my love,
I'll try breaking open your cocoon of despair
I'll bring you back up to the surface
So open your eyes; I'm right here with you

Schools of fish dart about like falling rain
As I dive even deeper into the depths
I want to find your soul's cry S.O.S
I've heard it, so there's no way I can ignore it

My love is insolent and powerful,
So prepare yourself
Once I've caught you in my embrace I won't let go, I won't
As soon as I break your cocoon, you're mine

What are you dreaming about?
Are you fixated on it?
I want to hurry and break it, that cocoon of yours
As I strike it, it quivers a bit
Sorry, I'm going to wake you up now

This is almost like destiny; it's gotten intense
It's hard to breathe,
I want to gently stroke your heart, here in the deep sea

With my love,
I'll try breaking open your cocoon of despair
I'll bring you back up to the surface
So open your eyes; I'm right here with you
With this insolent love, I'll take you for myself!
