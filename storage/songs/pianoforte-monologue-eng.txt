Many different sounds flow out from within me,
They’re not all beautiful, but a kind melody from somewhere
Blends in with my new dreams and tears in a concerto

Has it been slumbering all this time?
The passion within my heart
"Please wake up" I've realised that's what you called out to me that day

Although I face the keyboard alone, but,
I can feel it… I’m not alone
Our feelings are always connected, aren’t they?
I can put my faith in that,
That's why I can try anything I wish without fear
And become stronger


Although my body trembles with nervousness, I head towards the promised place that awaits me
I inhale deeply and take a large step forward

If I calmly and slowly
Move my fingertips
With a smile, I’ll play an arpeggio and become free

I want to envelop you in a world of music
Please accept these feelings of mine
I want the sound of my ‘thank you’s to reach you
That’s why I’m playing this melody
It might sound a little too grandiose, but it’s true
So please don’t forget it


Maybe I’ll be able to convey it through the piano, my appreciation for everyone
That’s why, that’s why I’ll play it again and again, this joyous melody

I want to envelop you in a world of music
Please accept these feelings of mine
I want the sound of my ‘thank you’s to reach you
That’s why I’m playing this melody
It might sound a little too grandiose, but it’s true
So please don’t forget it
I’m really glad to have met you, so please, don’t ever forget it
