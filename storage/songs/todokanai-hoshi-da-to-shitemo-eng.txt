If you sketch out your dreams, what will they look like?
Once you get fired up, no one can stop you
I want everyone to know that, that's probably how I feel

What should we do to achieve that?
If I was alone, that would be a bit difficult
It might be possible with everyone, let's get everyone involved

OH NO! Don't say it's impossible, please give it a try
OH NO! Try it even if it's impossible, I want to see a different future
We can go ahead!!

Even if it's an unreachable star (Star light, I hope you)
Keep on reaching out with your momentum
Don't decide that it's unreachable (Star light, I hope you)
Reach out! Worry about things later!

Aspirations are wonderful, you know?
Anyway, I want to imitate all of them
I'm sure everyone understands as well, come on, let's dance

OH NO! Don't say that you've lost, I don't want to be belittled
OH NO! It doesn't matter even if you've lost, this feeling is great
We can dance again!!

There are nights one can't sleep too (Bad night, I miss you)
Don't get discouraged, let's continue on
If you think you can't sleep (Bad night, I miss you)
Then get up! Here, I'll keep you company!


There are nights one can't sleep too, no one knows what lies ahead
If you think you can't sleep (Bad night, I miss you)
Then get up! Here, I'll keep you company!
Even if it's an unreachable star (Star light, I hope you)
Keep on reaching out with your momentum
Don't decide that it's unreachable (Star light, I hope you)
Reach out! Worry about things later!
Reach out! Worry about things later!
