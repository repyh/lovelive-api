Teleport? Teleport!

I want to see someone
“Someone?” I wonder who it is
Actually, my heart already knows

A name springs to mind
But I resist calling it out
It just makes me miss them more

Time to ourselves is important
I know this but it’s difficult
Aa, my impatient personality
Is still the same, it hasn’t changed so

As soon as I open the door to my room, the sandy beach is right outside
If you wait there
I’ll think, “this is the best” while my i-miss-you syndrome gets worse
There’s only one cure
Zoom-zoom fly over here, okay?
(Teleport? Teleport! Come flying)
Come here quickly
(That’s definitely impossible, right)
Yeah, sorry
(Teleport? Teleport! Come flying)
But I want to see you
(That’s definitely impossible, right)
I know that

Should we make our plans better?
I had to go outside
If we walk with a dog, then we’ll play fetch

“Proof is better than fortune”
I thought I read that somewhere
So basically, it depends on your actions?

If I’m tired of loneliness, then let’s make some noise
I’m longing to chat with you
Aa, my impatient personality
Is still the same, it hasn’t changed, hasn’t it?

Before I knew it, the sound of the waves drew closer
I inhale in the scent of the sea
Let’s cheer up; but even so my i-miss-you syndrome’s
fever is rising
Round-and-around it seems like it’s getting hotter
My heart… is hot!

(Teleport? Teleport!)

Wherever you are
I want to see you, we can meet, right?
A paranormal phenomenon
I wished for one just now; because, because

As soon as I open the door to my room, the sandy beach is right outside
If you wait there
I’ll think, “this is the best” while my i-miss-you syndrome gets worse
There’s only one cure
Come over quickly, okay?
Quickly = right now
Zoom-zoom I want you to fly over here
(Teleport? Teleport! Come flying)
Come here quickly
(That’s definitely impossible, right)
Yeah, sorry
(Teleport? Teleport! Come flying)
But I want to see you
(That’s definitely impossible, right)
I know that
