I want a world that's perfect and pure
Where there's nothing but beautiful things
Impossible? No, it's possible! I'm sure it is

You don't think I know the difference
Between fantasy and reality
Impossible? No, it's possible! I'm sure it's there

Believe in yourself more
And keeping moving
Ah, I'm clearly going to hug you
You should know this.

The perfect and pure world will come true
With the wishes that lie deep in your heart
I want to see people's faces when they are happy and laughing
So I want to become stronger than before
I hope the world

It's shaking, the sky was shaking
Would you want to ride on the shining star that flies?
It's shaking, the sky was shaking
Would you want to ride on the shining star that flies?

I like the lowest, most noble of rhythms
Contradictions enhances purity
Impossible? No, it's possible! I'm sure it is

Are you wondering what I am talking about?
It's something I like to daydream about
Impossible? No, it's possible! I'm sure it's there

I can feel the lowest, most noble of rhythms
It makes the power I have a lot stronger
Believe in yourself more
And keeping moving to where you want to go
It makes the power I have a lot stronger

The perfect and pure world will come true
With the wishes that lie deep in your heart
I want to see people's faces when they are happy and laughing
So I want to become stronger than before
So I want to become stronger than before
I hope the world
