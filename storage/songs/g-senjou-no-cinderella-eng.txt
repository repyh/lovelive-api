Go ahead and tell me what you wanna do, Please!
'cause I wanna go have fun!
Even if it's totally out there, we'll do it

This is way too sudden! No!
I don't really get it, but it sounds like fun!
So tell me, tell me, what should we do?

Hey, that sounds good! Let's all get dressed up
And do the Viennese Waltz!

Shall we dance?
Let's dance like it was a dream
We're tonight's unforgettable Cinderella
I'll take off my shoes quickly and lightly, so I won't lose them
Who should we invite? I'm getting riled up!


It’s no trouble at all, Surprise!
I want to see your happy faces
So I’ll make your every wish come true

Don’t tell me you were serious?! Stop!
Oh man, this is awesome, my heart’s pounding
All of us together, let’s have a dance party!

The biggest chandelier you’ve ever seen sparkles marvelously
The swelling violins gracefully summon the stars’ shine
The champagne glasses await for us to take them atop the silver tray
Makes you a little nervous, huh?
But don’t panic! Just smile real bright, like a princess!

Shall we dance?
Let us twirl and spin around like Cinderella
The aria makes us a little sleepy
So we gotta enjoy ourselves to the limit, until we’re all worn out!
Let’s dance forever! It's so exciting, right?

Shall we dance? Shall we dance?
Of course, let’s dance!
Let’s Dance!! Step with me!!

Come on, let’s do the Viennese Waltz together!

Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
Let's dance like it was a dream
We're tonight's unforgettable Cinderella
I'll take off my shoes quickly and lightly, so I won't lose them
Who should we invite? I'm getting riled up!
Let's dance forever, let's dance forever! It's so exciting, right?
