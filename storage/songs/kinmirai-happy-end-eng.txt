Your eyes only follow one single person
Despite there being a lot of others around, they follow only one
You understand this love now, right?
You don't have to hide it
I'll cheer for you with all my might

Do they live nearby? (What kind of person are they?)
My heart is beating too!
You have to confess with the right timing, right?
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! When will the chance come?

So it will surely be conveyed (A Happy End of mutual love!)
Because I want to see you laughing happily
It will surely be conveyed!
I hope the future I wish for isn't far away, either
But that's a bonus
What's important right now
Is for this love of yours to be realized, no matter what!

"Just the two of us", my heart's going to burst
Just by imagining it, I get scared
If I ever fall into this kind of love
You'd be the first one I'll tell

What do you do next? (Get closer!)
My heart is fluttering.
Confess with only a yes
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! Just go for it!

You've always longed for it (A fated Happy Love!)
So go and be happy! Enough to annoy me
What you've always been longing for
Saying it sure is embarrassing...Love is wonderful, isn't it?

Aah, when will that day come for me?
The love that you embrace is so dear

Where will "I like you" come from? (Before you realize it?)
My heart is fluttering and beating
You have to confess with the right timing, right?
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! When will the chance come?

So it will surely be conveyed (A Happy End of mutual love!)
Because I want to see you laughing happily
It will surely be conveyed
I hope the future I wish for isn't far away, either
But that's a bonus
What's important right now is for your love to be realized, no matter what!
