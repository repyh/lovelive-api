True dreams can't be stopped, won't be stopped
Our hearts are racing forward, right at this moment

Before I knew it, my love was in full bloom
I'll bring this feeling to the world
That's what I decided, so I'll make it happen

I wonder what we'll be able to achieve
Let's look up at the dazzling bright sky
And sing at the top of our lungs

Having something that we want to do
Brings joy to every single day
Don't you think so too?

Ah, I'm sure they're waiting for us
So many encounters, our very own start line!!
Our dreams start interweaving with one another
Now that we've realized what our true dreams are, we can't be stopped
Our hearts are racing forward, right at this moment

Please don't forget, what you love will never fade
Even if you try to hide it,
It's carved deep into your heart

It feels like we can do just about anything
Full of pride, we face forward
With smiles on our faces; we won't lose!

There's a place we want to go
So we won't be bored
Being with you is the best!

Ah, I know
Our start's been waiting for us 
Dreams bring with them more dreams, and we'll make them all come true
Our true dreams are strong, and they won't be stopped
Our hearts race forth, with nothing to stop them

When we stand at the start line,
Our goal feels so far away
But our star shines ever so brightly
Hearts racing with anticipation, we'll grab a hold of them
Someday, we all want to become a shining superstar

Ah, I'm sure they're waiting for us
So many encounters, our very own start line!!
Our dreams start interweaving with one another
Now that we've realized what our true dreams are, we can't be stopped
Our hearts are racing forward, right at this moment
Our hearts race forth, with nothing to stop them
