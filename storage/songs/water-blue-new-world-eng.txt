Now is now, and it's different from yesterday
It's not halfway to tomorrow, now is now
As these moments pile up, they disappear
I carve them into my heart WATER BLUE

I swam here through the world that opened up before me
After I decided that I didn't want regrets
"I won't give up!"
Just saying that won't make anything come true
"Move!"
I learned that things will change if I take action

I want to stay here forever, but,
I know I'll depart on a journey one day
That's why I want to make this time fun
Because I want to sear the greatest thrills into my heart

MY NEW WORLD
The time has come to find a new place
I'll cross the ocean to find the next shine
Since our desire to dream,
Will always connect with us, I'll go with a smile

Let's pile on the "nows" and head for the future!

Today has flown past as well
We've realised that we can't stop it,
Where are we headed now?
It's alright! We can always remember this,
That we've had a wonderful season

I love you all, so I always wanted to remain here
But we know it's time to go on a journey
The times that we worked hard together is precious to me
Let's treasure our greatest bonds forever

MY NEW WORLD
The days when our hearts seemed to be dancing
I'll cross the ocean chasing after them once again
Dreams aren't meant to be experienced only as dreams,
But something to be chased after through hardship

Now is now, and it's different from yesterday
It's not halfway to tomorrow, now is now
As these moments pile up, they disappear
I carve them into my heart WATER BLUE

NEW WORLD
The time has come to find a new place
I'll cross the ocean to find the next shine
Since our desire to dream,
Will always connect with us, I'll go with a smile

I'll carve this moment into my heart
I'll carve this moment into my heart, and everything about us
Let's pile on the "nows" and head for the future!
