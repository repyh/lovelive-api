Should I do this?
I should do this!

It's so wonderful
But maybe it's not for me?
If I think that way
I'll never change
So I guess I should do it!
Lo, the time has come!

I want you to watch me even when I'm stretching up a bit
Just kidding!
Yeah, it's embarrassing
Which way, which way, which way should I go?

La-lala, I've got it
La-lala, I've got it
I just have to go and do it!
I think momentum is important, after all
So before this thrilling feeling disappears
La-lala, I've got it
La-lala, I've got it
I just have to go and do it, and then
Lalala lalala, feels so good
Sorry, sorry, just forget about it
Maybe either way is fun
I should do this!

How cute
I want to be cuter
So many desires are overflowing
If I want to learn what they have
I guess I should do it!
I don't want to bloom too late!

I wonder if I can shine enough to sparkle just a bit?
Just kidding!
I want to ask, I can't ask
I really, really, want to try and ask!

La-lala even more
La-lala even more
Let's spin around cheerfully
Let's do everything we can think of
It gets fun once you've decided
La-lala even more
La-lala even more
Try spinning around cheerfully
Lalala, lalala, we have a
Good rhythm, good rhythm, I want to dance forever
That's how I want it to be

I want to make every single one of my dreams come true
I'm sure someday I can sparkle
That's my desire, la-lala
My heart wants to always chase after my desires

La-lala, I've got it
La-lala, I've got it
I just have to go and do it!
I think momentum is important, after all
So before this thrilling feeling disappears
La-lala, I've got it
La-lala, I've got it
I just have to go and do it, and then
Lalala lalala, feels so good
Sorry, sorry, just forget about it
Maybe either way is fun

Should I do this?
I should do this!
Should I do this?
I should do this!
