Amazing Travel
There are places
We still don't know about
Don't you think that's fun?
Our journey starts here!

It's almost time
We've gotten the sign
I believe baggage is something I don't need
"It'll be alright" you said with a smile
Ah, I want it to start now

In a world where nothing's certain
Let's search for what we love the most
Do you want to go now?
You do, don't you?
I thought so
I want to go too

Amazing Travel
Are you too busy?
It's like you've already given up
So we're flying away
C'mon take my hand, to brand new experiences

Floating away softly
Catching a break in the clouds
I saw a rainbow hanging like a bridge
Following my desires I started to move
Ah, I want to be excited

In a world full of security
It's boring...until I fall asleep
Do you want to go now?
You do, don't you?
I thought so
I want to go too

A DNA suitable for adventure has awakened, it's something everyone has

Amazing Transit
Our journey changes with the way the wind blows
Our destination changes too
Munching over the meaning of this new freedom
Today's list includes no plan
Amazing Transit
Someday we will drift away from each other
Don't you think we should meet again
In some land far far away?
And our journey, will continue!

In a world where nothing's certain
Let's search for what we love the most
Do you want to go now?
You do, don't you?
I thought so
I want to go too
