Landing action
Where should we play today?
Now, let's all Call & Dance!!

No matter where we go, our hearts become one
What we wish for will always be the same, right?
Furthermore, I want to share our strong bond
That’s right, I want to look at you right in front of me

Let’s jump together! And jump a little higher!
When I finally met you
Both our bodies and feelings became a lot lighter because of Yeah!!

From far away, I hear someone tell me to come over here
Even though I don’t know whose voice it is, I hear it loud and clear
There’s still tons of things I want to talk about
If I just wait, it’ll never be conveyed
So that's why I've come!

Our hearts can become one no matter what we do
I want to see your smile, even if your dance is rather sloppy
What's something that will never change?
Maybe it's the light that we secured in our memories just now

Let’s jump together! And jump a little higher!
When I finally met you
Both our bodies and feelings broke out into song because of Yeah!!

It's great when we have fun at a place that's perfect
I want to hear your voice more so I can smile more
It's unbearable how much I want to make sure
That those who experienced a thrill become friends
So that's why I've come!

So, let’s play over here; let’s play today!
