Nonstop nonstop the music
Nonstop nonstop the hopping heart

Why is it we seem too small maybe it's just us
But, but
Somehow, somehow it's a lot the things we've came through though
This looks like out of a dream

The things that I've never could have done
Alone used to be impossible but
With the power we've garnered together
They have become fun

Yes!
For us the future is ahead of the present
We have to get tightly a hold of ourselves
And then with our wings of freedom we will have to Fly away!!

Thrilled and full of joy let's all do it
If we dance we will come as on around the world
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's get together
Thrilled and full of emotion you should do it
Let your heart dance along and connect with everyone
This is something lovely we'll never stop to do　Yeah, that's right!

The like for what you like it's uncomparable
But, but
Why is it why is it too hard to explain it to everyone
Because there's no reason

So!
My future, that is something I decide myself
Playing it always safe it's really boring
Even though my wings are wet they're big so Fly away!!

I want to really find my reason to shine
In that case "Everything I've done 'till now" I'll have to leave it
Come on! Come on! Come on!
It's fine if crazy!
I want you to find your reason to shine
If that's the case then share your thoughts with everyone
Being what you want to do give it all from you　Yeah, right?　Yes, it is!

Everyone here　we love you!
Everyone here　we love you!

The times I put my words into a song like this
I pour all my feelings on it　don't ever forget it!

Thrilled and full of joy let's all do it
If we dance we will come as on around the world
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's get together
Thrilled and full of emotion you should do it
Let your heart dance along and connect wit everyone
This is something lovely we'll never stop to do　Yeah, that's right!
