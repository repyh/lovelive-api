Let our feelings become one (In this moment they join as one)
This is the moment weâ€™ve been waiting for

Once we realize it, everything will fall into place
Our hearts calling to the future with all their might
We'll move forward, holding each other's shaking hands

After missing each other along the way, we turn back at the same time.
See? That feeling in our hearts really was the same all along

In order to take hold of something, (Dreams are so complicated...)
It takes to never give up! (Right?)
Let our feelings become one
No matter where we may be, we believe in the same tomorrow

Wow wow, always following our hearts!
Wow wow, always joining as one!

Sometimes growing further apart, sometimes growing closer,
Things haven't gone too smoothly;
There was something I was never able to tell you

Putting on serious faces, we burst into laughter at the same time
We really are connected after all.. I'm so happy!

When chasing a dream that's precious to you, you realize who means the most to you
If your feelings always remain the same,
Then even if you're heading for different places, you can still believe

I was amid days that could never be replaced
I finally realized I'm not alone
Those irreplaceable days (in this place) continued on (one after another)
I finally realized I'm not alone ('Cause we're together)

In order to take hold of something, (Dreams are so complicated...)
It takes to never give up! (Right?)
Let our feelings become one
No matter where we may be, we believe in the same tomorrow
When chasing a dream that's precious to you, you realize who means the most to you
If your feelings always remain the same, (I can tell, our feelings are the same)
Then even if you're heading for different places, you can still believe (I believe)
