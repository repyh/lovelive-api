Dance out of your mind now!
Just passionately dance!

WANA-WANA DANCE
If we dance intensely, we could dance a sweet yet passionate DANCE
Is it midsummer?
My burning desires head straight to you
I wanna dance with you
WANA-WANA DANCE
Even if we get caught, the key is hidden in our eyes
Shall we stop?
Even if we do, surely we don't actually want to, right?
WANA-WANA DANCE yeah!

Let your heart soar as you burn
This everlasting PHOENIX DANCE yeah!

If I can't reach you, would you rather give up?
No, I want our fingertips to touch
So let's get rid of our hesitation
And gaze at one another before the next word escapes our lips

One second, we're softly saying our names, and the next?
Kiss! Ah, perhaps we'll be sighing

What do you want to dream about?
What do you want to dream about?
You don't know...Or you do know... regardless if you do or don't!
Let's DANCE!!

Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Oh PHOENIX PHOENIX DANCE

LUNA-LUNA DANCE
Dance out of your mind - dance this sky and night dance
Am I serious about you?
I am to the point of being scared to face you
I wanna dance with you
LUNA-LUNA DANCE
Once you catch it, you'll quickly succumb to dizziness
Shall we run away?
Even if we do, it's not like we can outrun it, right?
LUNA-LUNA DANCE yeah!

Let's fly above everything
This everlasting PHOENIX DANCE yeah!

A flower with a scent similar to love creates waves in my hair when put on my head
Filling your ocean, filling your thirsty heart
Sweat is dripping into the sand
Why not? If we're attracted to each other
Why not? Then we can touch each other...

While keeping an eye on our temperatures
kiss! I'm certain I'm going to melt if this continues

We always want to dream!
We always want to dream!
You're not sure... you're sure... regardless if you are or not!
Let's dance!!

Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Wow wow PHOENIX DANCE
Oh PHOENIX PHOENIX DANCE

WANA-WANA DANCE
If we dance intensely, we could dance a sweet yet passionate DANCE
Is it midsummer?
My burning desires head straight to you
I wanna dance with you
WANA-WANA DANCE
Even if we get caught, the key is hidden in our eyes
Shall we stop?
Even if we do, surely we don't actually want to, right?
WANA-WANA DANCE yeah!

Let your heart soar as you burn
This everlasting PHOENIX DANCE yeah!

Wow wow... my dreams don't matter
Wow wow... when I'm with you
