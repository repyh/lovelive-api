Why are you making that face?
You're happy to see me, aren't you? So say it, say it
Everyone, let's live while being true to ourselves
Trying to lie is a foolish waste of time

Even if we're far apart, I want you to call for me
It's not something unreasonable, come on
It doesn't matter how difficult it is right now,
I'm right here, right here

I want to dream of something more profound
Like a shooting star, streaking through
And tearing apart the black sky with its radiance

You've been waiting?
Is that so… I want to embrace you tight
Show me what your passion looks like!
We'll always return,
Even if the world falls apart
We'll be able to reunite again and again
I'm certain I'll find you again

"You're finally smiling again, aren't you?"
I'm relieved so I'll say it, say it
I'll live my life to the fullest again today,
I truly, truly believe everything I say

Life's a constant battle with yourself,
You can't just run away from it
It doesn't matter how scared you are
I'm right here, right here with you

I want my dreams to always be glowing
I'm sure this shooting star is
Shining, powered by everyone's desire

Where should we go?
Toward a place we've been longing for
After all… my heart doesn't want to be tied down
I'm always acting how I want
Like my feelings are leaping out of me
I want to meet you again and again
I'll do so in this new world; Warrior!!

My dreams will take in everyone's desires and
Like a shooting star, it'll streak through, streak through the sky
That's right, like a shooting star, it'll streak through, streak through the sky
And it'll make your wishes come true

This isn't a lie
I'll dash through the sky with the light that I have
After all, time can't be stopped!
Ah, we've had some serious arguments
We've talked about something seriously and gotten hurt
But even so, I want to believe again
Because we've met before, right?

You've been waiting?
Is that so… I want to embrace you tight
Show me what your passion looks like!
We'll always return,
Even if the world falls to pieces
I'm sure we'll be able to reunite again and again
I know because it's you
I'm certain I'll find your heart again
