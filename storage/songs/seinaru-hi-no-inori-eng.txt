Your wishes, the stars are watching
Shining gently, because they are watching

Even if I write a tear-colored diary
I'm whispering about the future beside the window

(Being held by) the quiet night,
Anybody (becomes dear)
Everyone is doing their best
Even if we disagree, it's okay

Holy night, even though it's the holy day
I waver
It's painful being alone
Holy night, the words of my prayer
Suddenly spilled out
Together with you, I wish for happiness

Picture your dreams in the sky
Picture a free future

A wonderful person (is who I want to be)
Whoever it is (I want to forgive)
Everyone is doing their best to better themselves
Even if we don't understand each other, it's okay

Holy star, oh, holy light
It'll always be there
It looks like you're not alone
Holy star, the words of my prayer
Quietly pour out
That joy will be in your heart

Holy star, oh, holy light
It'll always be there
It looks like you're not alone
Holy star, the words of my prayer
Quietly pour out
Joy shines and makes your heart become a star
Together with you, I wish for happiness

Holy night, Holy star with you...
