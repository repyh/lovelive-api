When things don’t go well
When I start to tear up
Chewing my lip, I wish, “Let tomorrow be clear!”

The two hearts, unconnected
But seemingly connected

A ship crosses over the sunset
So that it may carry away my worries,
I can still keep going. Shall I say this to the vanishing waves?
Look, I’m alright now, let’s run home
I want to tell you once we’re home
That I want to do interesting things...

When we start to move (it’ll be fun)
But we’ll often run into walls (what should we do?)
It doesn’t matter whatever we may think, “Let tomorrow be clear!”

Even still, today ends, and we face the next day
Are you crying again?
It’s fine! I’ll recover
Faster this time

The moon brings along sleep
As if gently caressing me
I can still keep going, I muttered softly, alone
Look, I’m alright! Maybe I’ll wake up early
I have to tell you
That I want to do new things

The moon brings along sleep
As if gently caressing me
I can still keep going, I muttered softly, alone
Look, I’m alright! Maybe I’ll wake up early
I want to do new things
I’ll have to tell you once I wake up
