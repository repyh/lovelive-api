Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
A festival for all our favorite things has begun!
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
I wanna eat my favorite foods with everyone!

Starting the day with an "umm, well, y'see..."
Let's get together, from morning till night
And horse around! Giddyup! Let's go for a ride!

Clip-clop, clip-clop, if we spread our good vibes around
The timpani in the sky will sound for all to hear
Let's get hyped! (Let's sing, let's dance)

I've sung a whole bunch (heave-ho)
And now I feel so hungry (heave-ho)
But in my pocket resides a box of infinite sweets
Yay! Yay! (Because it's a festival, after all)

Cotton Candy Ei-Ei-Oh!
Can I use my fluffy power on you?
Be h-h-h-h-happy, form a circle
And start dancing along to the music
Cotton Candy Ei-Ei-Oh!
If we gather up all our cuteness, the world will be a better place; it'll be fun

Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
A festival for all our favorite things has begun!
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
Alrighty, alrighty, heave-ho
I wanna eat my favorite foods with everyone!

With a bang and a crash, I wanna hit the stage while hitting the cymbals
Yup, I got it! Just leave it to me!
Let's get hyped! (Let's sing, let's dance)

I've danced a whole bunch (heave-ho)
And now I'm sweating like crazy (heave-ho)
It makes me want to jump into a huge tub of shaved ice
Whoosh! Whoosh! (Because it's a festival, after all!)

Chocolate Banana Ei-Ei-Oh!
It's time to eat something together
Be h-h-h-happy, and get a bite to eat
La-di-da, la-di-da, we'll stuff ourselves with happiness!
Chocolate Banana Ei-Ei-Oh!
If I can tell the world how yummy this food is, and make everyone smile, I'd be happy

Ei-Ei-Oh! (Ei-Ei-Oh!)
Ei-Ei-Oh! (Ei-Ei-Oh!)
You're doing what you love, Ei-Ei-Oh!
Make the world a sweeter place!!

Cotton Candy Ei-Ei-Oh!

It's a festival for everyone's favoritest of favorite things! (A festival for everyone!)

Cotton Candy Ei-Ei-Oh!
