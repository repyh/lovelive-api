Even though you've come so far
The answer is still beyond your reach
The light you thought you had grasped was only an illusion
Swallowed up by the darkness

DROPOUT!?
An abandoned passion stuck in an unexpected situation
What I regret is losing a sensation

Just where is that "shine"
You said you'd gain no matter what?

Even so Go to the world
Search for the edge
Of this unstoppable dream without exits
Go to the world
Loneliness is only distorting us
Who do you want to call for?

Having always been searching for meaning
That heartbeat of yours has been screaming
Wanting to see something certain
You have always been running
And have been loved by the darkness

Dropout!?
Pessimistic curation
Navigating towards evilness
You say that you don’t want that
Block your imitation

Unable to see the colour of the sky
But you can feel the radiance!

Out of the world pain
Splits the chest
Picking up the spilling fragments of dreams
Out of the world
After lamenting
One day it will move
So raise your face

Power that cannot be suppressed
Feelings that you don’t know how to deal with
Even when you’re unable to paint the future
Those dreams are still restless

Even so Go to the world
Search for the edge
Of this unstoppable dream without exits
Go to the world
Loneliness is only distorting us
Who do you want to call for?
