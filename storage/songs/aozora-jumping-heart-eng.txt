Let's chase the orbit of unseen dreams!

Shining Road
My feelings run
as I'm vigorously looking for you,
Wait a minute! This can't be,
It's the courage that touches us inside

The world's always full of
(more) hidden new doors
(Let's go!) I want to open them,
Let's look for them together!

I want to start my story (Right now), the blue sky is waiting for us,
It's a jumping heart that embraces our dreams,
a youth that advances straight to tomorrow,
It's our time to start our (sunshine story), the excitement's important to me,
Let’s go and take hold of our dreams
No matter what happens, even if we don't understand, let's look forward to it

Open Mind
We have to say it but we can't
Since no one should be able to do it perfectly from the start
For now, let’s fly energetically
From our start line, I wonder if the goal is far away.

In this shining world, I heard you call out for me
(More) I wanted to hear you
(Let’s go!) Towards the other side of the light
Let’s go together!

I want to change my future (So, where to) by rising up like the sun
Our dreams shined Charging heart
Let’s use all our strength to grant our desires Isn’t youth surprising!?
“I want to change,” I thought (Sunshine mission) Our feelings are surely important
Let’s go and take hold of our dreams
If it’s with everyone, it’s fine even if I can’t explain it

Jumping heart But the fact that I want to start
Charging heart I found it just about now
Where is the goal? I wonder where it is? I don’t know
I don’t know, but let’s still have fun

I want to start my story; The blue sky is waiting for us,
It's a jumping heart that embraces our dreams,
a youth that advances straight to tomorrow,
It's our time to start our (sunshine story), the excitement's important to me,
so let's go and catch our dreams!
Let's look forward happily and see what happens!
Let’s go and take hold of our dreams
If it’s with everyone, it’s fine even if I can’t explain it… so let’s go straight ahead!
