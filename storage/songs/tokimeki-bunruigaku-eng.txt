Why do I think? Why do I think?

Things such as dreamlike scenery and dreamlike happiness
If I call them "dreamlike", it wouldn't be a dream anymore

Complex talk is background music to me, where is my curiosity?
The name that came to mind at that time was a surprising one

Why is it
When I tried raising the lid on my emotions, they overflowed
Why is it
Just imagining it makes my ears grow hot

I just started learning that there're different types of excitement
That's why research is necessary
I wish that you could help me
It's not something on paper, but much more personal
That's why research is necessary
Help me unravel this mystery

Things such as dreamlike encounters and dreamlike coincidences
Don't call them "dreamlike", it's fine just as a dream right?

That's how it is
Don't erase these wonderful memories, don't destroy them
That's how it is
I love the excitement from my imagination alone

"Hesitation only gets in the way", you said as you pulled me out
I'm always going with my whims
If our bodies collide, will I discover something new?
In the midst of this new excitement, my heart took flight
I'm always going with my whims
If I try starting with my body...

Why is it my emotions are overflowing
That's how it is
The heart-throbs are uncountable

I just started learning that there're different types of excitement
That's why research is necessary
I wish that you could help me
It's not something on paper, but much more personal
That's why research is necessary
Help me unravel this mystery
If I throw away my hesitation... will there be excitement?

Why do I think? Why do I think?
