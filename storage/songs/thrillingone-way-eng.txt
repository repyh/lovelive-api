We want to shine!

My future, I’ll try, try, try
I’ll run with my all
My future, I’ll try, try, try
I’ll run with my all

I don’t want to be disappointed
What are you trying to protect?
Even if you’re down that’s okay, isn’t it?
Get up; it’s a seesaw game

I’ve cried countless times
It’s because I want to be overcome with emotion
Don’t you dislike being fine with whatever?
I’ve decided, this is my happy choice

I may be on the edge but (I can’t see the world)
I’m running towards the future (my future)
Thrilling One Way
That’s what I desire
I simply want to feel the heat of being alive!

I won’t stop, won’t stop, these feelings about to overflow
My sincere wish is to play throughout the world
I won’t stop, won’t stop, these feelings about to overflow
Not for anyone else’s sake, but for my own selfish passions

Do you take pride in being hopeless?
Giving up is a bad idea
Aim for the things you
unconditionally want, with a poker face

Don’t concede, after all
it’s rude to your opponent as well
Isn’t being indecisive a loss?
Grab it, the lucky star

Searching for excitement (Even if I get lost, I have a companion)
I’m running towards the future (My future)
Thrilling One Way
Those are my instincts
I want to feel my life burning up!

Don’t stop them, don’t stop them, these unreasonable wishes of ours
Our ambition is to make them true throughout this world
Don’t stop them, don’t stop them, these unreasonable wishes of ours
Everyone hides them; for our own selves, let’s go!

It’s getting hotter
It’s getting hotter
I want to feel alive!

I may be on the edge, but I’m running towards the future
That’s what I desire
I simply want to feel the heat of being alive!

I won’t stop, won’t stop, these feelings about to overflow
My sincere wish is to play throughout the world
I won’t stop, won’t stop, these feelings about to overflow
Not for anyone else’s sake, but for my own selfish passions
Let’s go for ourselves, come on!

My future, I’ll try, try, try
I’ll run with my all
My future, I’ll try, try, try
I’ll run with my all
