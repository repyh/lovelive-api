It keeps rising, Wow!
Here it goes, Oh yeah!
Our hearts rush beforehand
I can’t wait

If its thrilling… Wow!
With full force… Oh yeah!
I want to chase it in a state of pure excitement, Let’s go!!

Although there are no rails, I’ll keep running steadily ahead
Ah! Let’s become the wind, the wind of the future

I don’t want to forget, Braveheart
It’s within you too, Braveheart
My feelings about loving unknown places seem to have awakened
Tomorrow is uncertain
But that’s why it’s fun
Without adventure, life is monochrome
Let’s enjoy it in our own colour

Don't get rid of it, Wow!
It starts from here too, Oh yeah!
Let's search for things that we find beautiful
Let's search a lot

It is shining bright, Wow!
Towards the sun, Oh yeah!
We want to shout, we are at our best right now, Let's go!!

Where can the goal be? We ask ourselves while laughing loudly
Ah! I feel so happy so, let's laugh it out even more

I don't want to regret Braveheart
Let's release those feelings Braveheart
A world that's better than expected, growing even wider—that's what an adventure is
For a tomorrow full of amazement
Just that it what makes it fun
If you challenge it you'll get your desired crossfade
And you'll come to understand your own dreams!

Braveheart Jet Coaster
Is it scary? Is it fun?
Let's become the wind, a wind towards the future

I don’t want to forget, Braveheart
It’s within you too, Braveheart
My feelings about loving unknown places seem to have awakened
Tomorrow is uncertain
But that’s why it’s fun
Without adventure, life is monochrome
Let’s enjoy it in our own colour
