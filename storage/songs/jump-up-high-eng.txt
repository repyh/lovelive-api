Jump up high
Into the sky towards the dancing birds
Let's fly with only hope in our hearts

These words may not be beautiful but they come from within
I'll show you more fragments of my true feelings

Take a chance!! We can still make it
Take a chance!! Be true to yourself!
Take a chance!! So let's chase
After our future

The feelings born that day have started moving
"It's now, it's now!" I hear a voice say, the moment is ripe

Jump up HIGH!
The wind gives us courageous, fresh courage
What you can do now is just let it begin!
Ah it's not stupid if you're having fun!
Big or small, I don't care! Jump up higher!!

I'm not embarrassed to be earnest
I'm proud of myself, if I can do just one thing
It'd be feeling proud of myself, so how about it?

Keep going!! Because happiness
Keep going!! Has many varieties
Keep going!! I'll make one you like and give it to you

One day we'll be there, close to our dreams
One more step, one more step, let's dance together
You have fully blossomed!

Jump up HIGH!!
Into the sky towards the dancing birds
Let's fly with only hope in our hearts
Being happy is the best, no use always being down!
Let's laugh from our hearts, Jumpin' up higher!

Tell me what kind of dreams you have sleeping within you

Jump up HIGH!!
The wind gives us courageous, fresh courage
What you can do now is just let it begin!
Ah it's not stupid if you're having fun!
Big or small, I don't care! Jump up higher!!
Being happy is the best, no use always being down!
Let's laugh from our hearts, Jumpin' up higher!
