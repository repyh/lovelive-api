There's another helping of my happy life!
I'll chase after my goals, I'll chase after my goals, because there's no limits!

I've tried my hand at all sorts of things Wow wow
And the more I try, the more I think "Ah, I want to know more!"

When you get better at doing things, you gain a hunger for more, don't you? Wow wow
So it seems like I can go even further now, right? "Of course! I'm gonna go!"

Rather than thinking about what the future holds, let's dance with the joy of right now!
I'll chase after what I love; I'm being chased!?

I want to try, try even more things!
Ah, I'll aim for a goal beyond my wildest dreams; let's go!
Aren't limits like, a thing for a century from now?
It'll be so exciting and fun!
I'll go to the ends of the earth! Happy life!

I want to try new things
I'll go along with the waves; doo-wop doo-wop
I want to grow
There's more of my happy life; doo-wop doo-wop

What kind of feelings do you have? Strong ones! Don't give up on them Wow wow
The impossible is beating out the logical. "That looks great, we'll be okay!"

You're not just 'someone,' you're the protagonist of your own life!
I'll race through mine, how I like!

I want to go, go on a nonsensical adventure!
Ah, we'll be driven forward by our emotions; let's smile!
I've stretched myself out as much as I can
And now it seems like I can fly way up high
If you believe in me, before you realize it, I'll have started glowing!

I have a dream; I've come here by swimming through my dreams
I want to shine, until the end of time! "All together now!"

I want to try, try even more things!
Ah, I'll aim for a goal beyond my wildest dreams; let's go!
Aren't limits like, a thing for a century from now?
It'll be so exciting and fun!
I'll go to the ends of the earth! Happy life!

I want to try new things
I'll go along with the waves; doo-wop doo-wop
I want to grow
There's more of my happy life; doo-wop doo-wop
I want to try new things
I'll go along with the waves; doo-wop doo-wop
I want to grow
There's more of my happy life; doo-wop doo-wop
