Ride a wave!

I've been waiting for when our hearts overlap
I want to believe that my feelings will reach you

We're connected despite being far apart
I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling this way

That's why all I really want to do is play
I wonder what I should do while laughing with everyone?

Ride a wave!

More, more, more, and more!
I want to be with you
The number of waves are infinite, so let's sway for a little while
More, more, more, and more!
I want to be with you
I want to show you the blue sky, and take you out to sea
Swimming, diving; when we feel the wind, we should ride a wave!

I'll keep these memories safe
I won't let these warm wishes disappear

We're connected despite being far apart
That's what a voice inside of me said

That's why I'm very glad to be with you now
If it's okay with you, I want to hug you!

Hold me tight!

Because, because, because, because!
I want to be with you
The sound of the waves are telling us to look at the shining sunset
Because, because, because, because!
I want to be with you
As the red sun melts into the ocean
I can't find the words to say this, so just hold me tight!

More and more Ah! Just because ah!
I've been waiting for this moment when our hearts become one
I don't want to walk past you anymore
We'll be together from now on ...Hold me tight!

More, more, more, and more!
I want to be with you
The number of waves are infinite, so let's sway for a little while
More, more, more, and more!
I want to be with you
I want to show you the blue sky, and take you out to sea
Where we splash about in the cold water
Swimming, diving; when we feel the wind, we should ride a wave!

I want to play with you forever
More!
