You're fragile
You're fragile

You're always scared while giving a smile
I understand the feeling of not wanting to be hated
That's why you won't say anything of the truth
You swallow a single breath and endure it

Just stop it already and show your heart only to me
I love your eyes that are about to cry
And your defenseless, clumsy way of living too

If we don't protect these fragile things, they will be broken
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight

You're fragile

The hesitation you convey makes my chest hurt
Some people just don't know what such kindness is
But then I discover the truth
When we got together, you don't have to endure anymore

Right now, show your grief only to me
I like that you think too much
The complete opposite of me

Don't break these fragile, fleeting feelings
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight

Your heart is already injured from being afraid of getting hurt
Were you waiting for me? I found your Real heart

If we don't protect these fragile things, they will be broken
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight
Don't break these fragile, fleeting feelings
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight
Fragile love, fragile things

You're fragile
Fragile love
You're fragile
