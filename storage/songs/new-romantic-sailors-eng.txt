New Romantic Sailors, Sailors!

Recently, things have begun to change—
You’ve finally realised that, too, haven’t you?
There exist a countless number of worlds
There exist worlds that we cannot see

Knock, knock! Knock against the sky
Knock, knock! And a gate will open
We’ll go and board this mysterious starship
Sailors, let’s go! Sailors, let’s go!
And we’ll head beyond the sparkling light!

What kind of adventure do you wanna have?
This hyper drive, steadily gaining speed, seems to have even flown past time
It’s starting to rise even higher, so
Shall I grab your hand?
“I wanna go on an adventure!” That instinctive decision is the right answer!
That’s why I wanna, wanna go with you
On this red planet, let’s swim in the sea of the blue moon!

Beyond these flipped letters,
Surely a place where we can have fun is calling
There exist a countless number of worlds
There exist worlds that we do not know of

Shock, shock! The window reflects
Shock, shock! A dangerous light
Our starship slips past the fading star
Sailors, let’s go! Sailors, let’s go!
And we’ll head towards the Milky Way that makes our hearts dance!

I wanna have even more adventures!
Drifting steadily further away, the laser beam from the town we’ve grown tired of seeing
Whispers to us, “Don’t come back”
So shall I wrap my arms around your shoulders?
“I wanna go on an adventure!” Because we’ve never done this before, burning flames of curiosity lick at my feet!
That’s why I wanna, wanna go with you
On this white comet, let’s dance in the midst of the frolicking black snow!
