Hello! New world!
My heart is full of hope

Everyday is so much fun
That's why I'm alive to think that
Let's try so many things
Like find the things we love
Surely there's more beyond
Our never ending dreams. Let's find it together!

I believe in you, and I believe in myself
Did that sound too cool? (Sun ∞ shine evolution)
Anyway I meant what I said!

Future flight
How far do you want to fly? (Let's fly!)
We've been given the green light to draw in the sky (Aqours JET!)
Premonition → determination = future
Let's move on with you!
Future flight
Let's fly wherever we want to (Let's fly!)
No matter what happens from here on out
Something might happen beyond our wildest dreams...Future flight!!

Yesterday will be a great memory
All the fun has to come together
If you try to do something new
There will be many discoveries
It is important to be honest with the changes we make
The magic of affirmation instead of denial

You believe in you, I believe in me
I already made a decision (Sun∞shine evolution)
And you? Have you already done it?

Future sky
Let's dream and fly (Let ’s fly!)
There is no capacity in the sky, and a fierce dash (Aqours JET!)
Tomorrow + (of) tomorrow = (ha) future
I would be happy if you were there!
Future sky
If you dream, fly (Let ’s fly!)
What will surprise you from now on
Wait for something beyond your imagination...Future sky !!
Ah, it's burning

If you open your mind, the future will be full of hope
Far away, far away, crossing borders and across the sea
You have to ask for it!
You have to want it big!

Future flight
How far do you want to fly? (Let's fly!)
We've been given the green light to draw in the sky (Aqours JET!)
Premonition → determination = future
Let's move on with you!
Future flight
Let's fly wherever we want to (Let's fly!)
No matter what happens from here on out
Something we cannot image could happen…
There is a vast sky out there waiting for us...Future flight!!
It's on fire, "flight!"
