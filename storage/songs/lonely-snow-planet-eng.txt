On this frozen, lonely planet
Will there be someone to answer me if I call loud enough?
It seems that our hearts, raring to fight back, have been drawn to one another
Hey, haven't you noticed?

I'm not looking for peace of mind here,
Amidst this harsh blizzard
I just need to be able to get back up again
No matter how painful the fall is

I never stop! If I stand firm, right before my eyes
A new world, and the future ahead will show themselves to a new me
I've got the courage to change right here so,
Instead of talking, shall we dance more instead?

Trust me, open the book of dreams in your heart
What'll be in there? Let's see!
O.K. your singing voice carries a beautiful pride
Let's go! One two, 1, 2, 3, 4

Burn it up! As your lonely soul wanders
It discovers a new story and plays it for all to hear
I wanna dancing, you wanna dancing
Whenever we're cold, we'll hold on to the warmth of our dreams! Here we go!

You find a way! Even if you lose something on the way to our meeting, you'll find it again
A new world, and the future ahead, will always be waiting for you tomorrow
Since we've run this far, I'm sure
We'll see a constellation no one's seen before

I'm not looking for peace of mind here,
Amidst this harsh blizzard
I just need to be able to get back up again
No matter how painful the fall is

I never stop! If I stand firm, right before my eyes
A new world, and the future ahead will show themselves to a new me
You find a way! Even if you lose something on the way to our meeting, you'll find it again
A new world, and the future ahead, will always be waiting for you tomorrow
Since we've run this far, I'm sure
We'll see a constellation no one's seen before
Keep on running, Lonely Snow Planet
