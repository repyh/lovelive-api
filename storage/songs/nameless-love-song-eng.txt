Our hearts are connected
That's what makes this world worth living in

A song with no name was born
When the drops of love fell
My heart's desire spreads like a wave

Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
It sounds so beautiful
Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
Why do I feel like I'm about to burst into tears?
I'll tell you how I feel without hesitation
Love is all, love is all
It's that simple

Once we become one, our desires will too
I'll grab onto that hand I can't see
Grab on tightly, it doesn't matter how far apart we are, let's sing together
You can hear me
And I can hear your voice from anywhere in this world

When a nameless song arrives
I'll accept a piece of your love
Let's dream a dream that will never be awakened.

Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
What a wonderful sound
Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
Why do your words pierce my heart?
Now I'll tell you how I feel
Love is all, love is all
It's that simple

This nameless song, this nameless love
I feel like they're the reason I'm alive... I'm sure of it!

Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
It sounds so beautiful
Nameless Love Song
Nameless Love Song
Why do I feel like I'm about to burst into tears?
I'll tell you how I feel without hesitation
Love is all, love is all
Now I'll tell you
Love is all, love is all
This nameless love
