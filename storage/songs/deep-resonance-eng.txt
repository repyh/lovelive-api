A voice that won't reach anyone is running through the darkness

Is hope born from this place
Or perhaps, is this where it goes to die?
That isn't true "it screamed" my own "heart" did
It has a hot and burning soul

Fight back! I want to be more reckless
Hurry up! I want to believe more more
More? I finally realized that truth
If you keep silent it won't come true, if you just pray for it it'll never be true
The time to start to act is right now!

Pain and grief are things that can devour your dreams
A voice that won't reach anyone tries to run through the darkness
I won't allow myself to see such a sad world
Our Resonance... I can feel it!

To appreciate the taste of despair it's needed to renounce to life
When it is told to "start running", my heart burns in instinct, a passion that lights up at the sound

It's ringing even more
It's okay to ring it more
Don't ever make it stop
The unreasonable starts to come true
It's coming to reality with force, we can do it as long as there's will to fight!

These lights that are lit up with prayers will always keep your dreams illuminated
For someday your heartbeat will connect with someone and you will meet
In a world that seems soon to break down for us to meet is no coincidence
Our Resonance is a deeper loving

Pain and grief are things that can devour your dreams
But yet the light will always keep your dreams illuminated
For someday your heartbeat will connect with someone and you will meet
In a world that seems soon to break down for us to meet is no coincidence
Our Resonance... I can feel it!
Make your voice call out through the darkness
