I wanna be told I'm the best, this is serious; We gotta go!

Dreams are dreams, but they can't easily be reached
Let's aim for a special something, shall we?
For that sake, I won't cry
Who's my enemy? My enemy is the shadow of my weak self

You understand that, right?
Weak hearts are forbidden (I won't allow them)
I feel it! Tightly; The place where I now stand
SELF CONTROL!!

I want (One more chance time!)
Everyone to tell me I'm the best! (I wanna be told I'm the best!)
Dance now! Dance now!
I have decided (One more chance time!)
I'll make you tell me I'm the best! (This is serious, this isn't a game!)
Dance now! Dance now!

Let's aim more for that distant light, Baby! I want us to fly together more, Baby!
Even though my fingertips tremble, don't look
What's important is SELF CONTROL!!

May it be love or passion, I don't wanna lose my cool
Because I've already reached for loneliness
Now, shut up and move, Breakdown! Then, Break out from the night of momentum!
I understand it already; Loneliness is something you aim for yourself
Now, I'll bet everything on it; I've decided I'll keep looking forward
Who's my enemy? My enemy is the dread of my strong self

You understand that, right?
I've got to throw away these powerful fears (These fears... I'll throw away!)
I promise to you, I'll bring you to a wonderful place

No one (Best life, best mind!)
Can be as strong as me, right? (Convince yourself that you're the strongest!)
Dance now! Dance now!
There is (Best life, best mind!)
No one to replace me as the strongest (You don't want to be written off, right?)
Dance now! Dance now!

That unfading light, Baby! Is definitely calling for me, Baby!
Repressing my sighs of hesitation, I've prepared
And I will continue to run, in this SELF CONTROL!!

Convincing myself that I'm the strongest, to the summit, We gotta go!

CONTROL yeah!
Dreams are dreams, I realized I can't end them
Quickly, quickly voice it, erase all of your complaints
Dance now! Dance now!
CONTROL yeah!
Convince, convince yourself of your strength; Crush your weakness everyday
Bring out, bring out your Energy; Today will be today's evolution!
Dance now! Dance now!

I want (One more chance time!)
Everyone to tell me I'm the best! (I wanna be told I'm the best!)
Dance now! Dance now!
I have decided (One more chance time!)
I'll make you tell me I'm the best! (This is serious, this isn't a game!)
Dance now! Dance now!

Let's aim more for that distant light, Baby! I want us to fly together more, Baby!
Even though my fingertips tremble, don't look
What's important is SELF CONTROL!!
I will continue to run, in this SELF CONTROL!!
