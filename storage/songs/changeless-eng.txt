Whose lost item is this?
A single buried sandal
If I pick it up and examine it

My thoughts fly away
to a season of hot sands
That's right,
our sweat and tears
smelled of the sea

If I don't hurry and look up
It'll certainly spill over again
I'll want to go back to those days of youth again

"I'm waiting here." Even though I want to tell you that
My words dance in the air and disappear into the sky
"I'm waiting here." It would be great if I could tell you that
Walking alone on the seashore, I can only hear the sound of the waves

That small shine
was just a shard of glass
We've repeated such a thing so many times

Did we find
a large, unchipped seashell?
That's right,
everyone was always
searching for one

Even if you go far away
Even if we were to be separated
As long as the time we spent in the same season is carved into our hearts
It's going to be alright

"I'm waiting here." Even though I want to tell you that
My words dance in the air and disappear into the sky
"I'm waiting here." It would be great if I could tell you that
Walking alone on the seashore, I can only hear the sound of the waves

"Someday,
maybe someday,
someday we'll meet again." I muttered
Now you are on a new road
Let's meet again someday
