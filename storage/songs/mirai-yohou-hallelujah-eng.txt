I'll shout out my love!
Facing my dreams head on, it's all I can do!

Feeling uneasy like a burden
Hiding my feelings for what I care most about
Deep down inside though, I want to ignore that
To do my best, even though it sends down shivers

A gust of wind blows through, and it makes my skirt flutter
And then, it hit me
I can make a change!

I'm not gonna hold back my feelings for what I love anymore
(Even if I might cry) I'll chase after my dreams
I'll transform into a new feather, and fly into a new sky!
(I can already hear it) My future's forecast is sunny Hallelujah!

No matter how high the wall is, I'll climb over it

I'm not gonna hold back my feelings for what I love anymore
(Even if I might cry) I'll chase after my dreams
I'll transform into a new feather, and fly into a new sky!
(I can already hear it) My future's forecast is sunny, Hallelujah!
I'll believe in my self, Hallelujah!
