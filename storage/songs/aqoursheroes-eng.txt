Yaa-Yaa!!

Okay! We're all set and ready to go!
"What were you guys called again?"
I don't want to pretend not to know! Ugh!
Aqours☆PUNCH!!

Hey, if you ever need advice
Call us over right away!
We'll head there on our jet at mach speed, so
Hang on just a moment more!

No one can beat us, we want to believe that!
Move forward with all our might; we are HEROES!
"Kind of a strange choice for a heroine, aren't you?"
That's something we keep hearing (Wow!)

Let's picture ourselves blowing our worries out of sight, and fight on!
Somehow, I get the feeling we'll get stronger that way
Let's picture ourselves blowing our hesitation out of sight, and fight on!
Somehow, I can tell we're gonna get stronger
That's who we are!

Come on, show some spirit
"Just who are you guys?"
I could say, but
Aqours☆FLASH!! It's a secret!

Come on, tell us what's wrong!
Call us right over!
When you're down or in shock and feel like crying
Stay strong just a moment more!

Don't heave out a sigh (Grab on to my hand)
It's from here on out! Follow us!
Further ahead! (So!) Full speed ahead! (So!) Come on
(Hurry!) Come on already!

I want to give my wish voice; let's fight standing on this stage
I get the feeling it'll turn into a dream to fulfill!
I want to give my feelings voice; let's fight standing on this stage
Like that, they'll turn into a dream to fulfill!
It's definitely something we're all meant to do together!

We wanna try it, we're gonna try it, we wanna try it, we're gonna do it!
So come on already! (Wow!)

Let's picture ourselves blowing our worries out of sight, and fight on!
Somehow, I get the feeling we'll get stronger that way
Let's picture ourselves blowing our hesitation out of sight, and fight on!
Somehow, I can tell we're gonna get stronger
Aqours☆HEROES, that's who we are!

Yaa-Yaa!!
