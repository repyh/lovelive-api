"It's as if it was a dream"
I say, but there's no need for "as if"
Surely, the dream itself was genuine
For it's the best dream that my heart caught

Ever since our first encounter
Both happiness and sadness are a new tomorrow

Will it be just a memory one day? Not yet
It’s in the present continuous tense – “ing”!
Let’s leave nostalgia behind us
So we'll run again. Will we run? I want to run
It’s the present continuous tense – “ing,” right?
What road meets your eyes?

I’m not so weak that I’ll break if you touch me
So come closer
Now, let's embrace today
Talking about our dreams and our connected feelings make us stronger

These all were born here
Our hopes, our pains...They're so dear to me

Have they disappeared? They haven't
I think, dreams are always in continuous tense, “ing”
Let's attack instead of defending
Our curiosity won’t ever disappear – it’d be boring if it did
This is definitely the continuous tense – “ing,” right?
Decide on your path and go straight ahead!

Ever since our first encounter
Both happiness and sadness are a new tomorrow

Will it be just a memory one day? Not yet
It’s in the present continuous tense – “ing”!
Let’s leave nostalgia behind us
So we'll run again. Will we run? I want to run
It’s the present continuous tense – “ing,” right?
What road meets your eyes? i-n-g, I TRY!!
