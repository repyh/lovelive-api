From here on, you and I will go left and right
We will each choose our own future
We will no longer be able to see each other

While sharing our many dreams with each other
How quickly the seasons have passed

It's graduation, isn't it?
Now that we are here
Why is that we've let go of each other's hands?
Somewhere along the way
I feel that we grew up a little
That's probably why - it is a path that all must follow

Before signaling our farewell
Both you and I
Will swim through our memories
Will realize we can no longer see each other

The joy of meeting you carried a sadness
But I'm not saddened by it

Though it's our graduation
Don't forget me, keep holding me
Someday this throbbing will be so nostalgic
But it won't be until much later
That I'll understand there won't be another
Today I just go far off, and tomorrow a different road waits for me

While sharing our many dreams with each other
How quickly the seasons have passed

It's graduation, isn't it?
Now that we are here
Why is it that we've let go of each other's hands?
Somewhere along the way
I feel that we grew up a little
That's probably why - it is a path that all must follow
Is it not...?
Is it not...?
Is it not...?
