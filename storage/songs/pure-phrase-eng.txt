Where is the new world that my heart has sketched out?
Ah, where could it be?

Surely, dreams are made of fragments,
And when I collect enough,
I'll finally understand the scenery that I've been searching for

"Let's fly beyond our limits!"
When I realized that I had that wish,
That was where it all began

"There are all kinds of futures,"
What taught me that was
Bravery and tears and everyone's smile

Hey, are meetings magic?
If we hadn't met, then I wouldn't be the me I am now,
That would have been so lonely
I want to convey what comes next through my song
But I'll keep it a secret just for a bit longer,
Because inside my heart these pure phrases have only just been born

Today as well, I want to fix my eyes on
The people who talk about their dreams
And then, I'll join them in looking ahead

In the midst of uncertainty,
There's something glimmering beautifully... is it the power of belief?
I won't let go of it

These emotions are connected to the future,
Please don't ever forget that;
These small joys will keep piling up

That's right, I want to know more!
Discovering an unknown world seems more fun
Than just hiding alone in my shell
"I want my dreams to come true!" I want to convey that through my song
If you accept it then I'll softly play out
My hopes in a pure phrase

The new world (where is it?)
That my heart has sketched out (ah, where is it?)
Strangely, I'm not afraid of it, so I smile!

Meetings that are like magic do exist
I can say that because I am who I am now, I'm glad that I'm here

Hey, meetings are magic!
If we hadn't met, then I wouldn't be the me I am now
That would have been so lonely
I want to convey what comes next through my song,
But I'll keep it a secret just for a bit longer
Because inside my heart these pure phrases have only just been born

PURE PHRASE these fragments of my dream
PURE PHRASE will transform into my song
PURE PHRASE these fragments of my dream
PURE PHRASE are becoming my song
