Setting off anew
Is always a wonderful thing
Even though we're parting ways
A smile, I have to smile

Really, I want to chase after you
But I'll see you off
Because next time we meet, I want to show you
How much I've grown, so I'll keep working hard here

I swear I won't forget
All the things you've taught me
The day we meet again in the future isn't far

Graduation bye bye's, "I won't cry," I say, as I wave my hand
Congratulations!
Every beginning has an end they say
But y'know, the reverse is true too
Endings lead to new beginnings
Congratulations, congratulations!
Doesn't that sound better? Definitely...

A new journey
Will call on everyone
For us too, who saw you off
The time will come when we're seen off, isn't that right?

We want to greet you with our heads held high
And that's why, we'll forge on
Where should we aim our goal? Let's decide now

Graduation bye bye's, are these cherry blossoms? They're raining down
Congratulations!
They say every meeting is meaningful
And that's because I've come to love you
Our bond was born from it
Congratulations, congratulations!
My longing for you will never disappear

Today is graduation, bye bye, the cherry blossoms are raining down
Congratulations!
They say every meeting is meaningful
And that's because I've come to love you
Our bond was born from it
Congratulations, congratulations!
My longing for you will never disappear
Forever, forever...
