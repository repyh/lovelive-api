Where did you come from?
"From far away"
You seemed to answer, with out answering
You were in a world that I know nothing of
These are what the color of my sighs makes me think

It truly was a painful oath
But my voice sings of tomorrow with a smile

If I just hold the certain things in my heart
Things will work out somehow
Why is it that I can say that so easily?
Everyone wishes for courage
I know that it is how I feel
But people tend to waver

Where are you aiming for?
"Far away"
Your answer pointed to the sky
With you, I want to talk about places we haven't yet seen
The beating of our dancing hearts in the future

Soon we'll set out from here for what's next
That smile of yours (has no hesitation)
I'm jealous that it is so brilliant

Since I want my dreams to come true
It's important to never give up
Why is it that I can say that so earnestly?
If I just receive some courage I'll be fine
From those hot feelings of yours
That I've received, I'm passionate too


It truly was a painful oath
But my voice sings of tomorrow with a smile

If I just hold the certain things in my heart
Things will work out somehow
Where I go I will keep on saying that
If I just receive some courage I'll be fine
It is not just me who has received
Those passionate feelings of yours
But the world too is burning with them
