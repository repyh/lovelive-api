Walking with just a trot in our step
(Trot, trot)
Feels like something is missing
(Trot, trot, trot)
So with a big call (Yes Sir)
Change the tempo to that SunSun march!

With high spirits, through their drowsiness
So many different people come to gather
When did our hearts come so close together?
Now change to a gallop!

Go! We gotta go!
The world is always changing
Go! We need a new map!
We still don't know what tomorrow holds (holds) holds (holds)
Too many things, so let's start on our journey!
Marching with you, if our march is heard it's a sign!

Even if we catch up, with our hearts beating
(ba-dump, ba-dump)
Soon I'll want to see even more again
(ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump)
I want to taste (yes, sir!)
A different kind of dream, and SunSun march some more!

If we're brave and get lost
Let's struggle through with a crude smile
"Somehow we'll do it" are the only words you need
When you find yourself stuck

Shine! Be shining!
Even you carry the wish to fly
Shine! The future isn't set
I have hopes that it'll be fun (it will) it will (it will)
There's so much hope, I know now
Marching with you, our march will resound
Go! It's time to go!

Stop trotting, we gotta go fast!
But at a tempo just right for you
I woke up with my heart beating, it's time to shine!
Keep going, keep going, into the distance

Go! We gotta go!
The world is always changing
Go! We need a new map
To the future we don't know of yet
Shine! Be shining!
Even you carry the wish to fly
Shine! The future isn't set
I have hopes that it'll be fun (it will) it will (it will). So much hope

I know that now, and marching with you
Our march will resound, so we gotta go
Go! It's time to go!
Go! Go! Go!
