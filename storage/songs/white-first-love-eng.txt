Worrying that my feelings won't reach you
Only causes me suffering
Unable to tell anyone, the night my heart trembles for you
Is that when love begins?

I thought that I could always find the correct answer
But there are exceptions as well
My innocence is not enough in this hazy situation
I'm at a loss as to how to look for clues

Getting hopeful just because of a word
And despairing because of another
This passion is much too frightening for me

Worrying that my feelings won't reach you
Only causes me suffering
Unable to tell anyone, the night my heart trembles for you
Is that when love begins?

Even after listening to me, you didn't believe me
I thought my feelings were supposed to be straightforward

I want you to be kind to me, no, that’s not it
I want this prickling feeling to continue
It frightens me what is awakening within

Your eyes really are unfair, aren’t they?
The twinge of loneliness in them
Attracts me because they are so similar to mine; I'm unable to turn back
This is the beginning of love, right?

Your eyes really are unfair, aren’t they?
The twinge of loneliness in them
Attracts me because they are so similar to mine; I'm unable to turn back

My feelings have evolved, and I want them to reach you
A wish is born
I don’t want to continue being unable to tell you; the night my heart raced towards you
Is when it became love

Ah WHITE LOVE Ah FIRST LOVE
Love begins
