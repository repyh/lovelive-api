Kiss!
I want to fly to you and take you away, so
I don't need a response, it's useless to argue
Kiss!!
Your indifferent manner's just a lie, isn't it?
I already know there's heat in your eyes

Being bold is just my nature
If I say it like that
Leave it to instinct, there's nothing else
Hey, come over here

You calling calling

"Guilty Kiss" One night just like a dream
"Guilty Kiss" Let's dance til morning
"Guilty Kiss" Everything will pass, but that's why it's beautiful
"Guilty Kiss" One night just like a dream
"Guilty Kiss" Let's dance til morning
"Guilty Kiss" After everything has passed, you and I will fall in love…yes!!

Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss, Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss!

Touch!
Playing a sinful trick on your heart
A meaningful wink, it's only superficial courtesy
Touch!!
Instead of a trap, call it magic
That way, you feel like you can't help it

Acting like I'm messing around, even though I'm serious
It's fun that way
This way is better than being calm
Hey, come here

You dancing dancing

"Guilty Night" I want to be lit up by starlight
"Guilty Night" Forget everything
"Guilty Night" What was the meaning of our meeting? Until we find out we'll be shaking my song

I won't do it in a roundabout way like acting like I want you to invite me
I might seem too strong, oh yeah!
When I miss you I want to go right to you, passion!
You should feel that way too
It's selfish, but it's love, it's destiny
And I don't feel like changing it
When I miss you I want to go right to you, I won't restrain myself
I want to steal away the things I desire. Guilty Kiss!

You calling calling

"Guilty Kiss" One night just like a dream
"Guilty Kiss" Let's dance til morning
"Guilty Kiss" Everything will pass, but that's why it's beautiful
"Guilty Kiss" One night just like a dream
"Guilty Kiss" Let's dance til morning
"Guilty Kiss" After everything has passed, you and I will fall in love…yes?

Guilty Kiss, Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss, Guilty Night!
