I wanted to meet you, even if we were far apart,
Someday we will meet again

Since we all had different dreams, they all came true in different ways
Ah, I understand now
But, I’m sure that when we realized that,
Beautiful bonds between us were born, irreplaceable bonds

We chase after each other and miss each other (Always)
Miss each other and chase after each other (Always)
I’ll treasure the joy we felt when our paths finally crossed
This won’t be the last time, okay? (I want to talk with you more, and more!)

Over the rainbow
Let’s sing while basking in the light and our hearts will be connected
Let’s make a promise on the vanishing rainbow
I won’t ever forget you
So don’t ever forget me

(Oh! So we go!)
Nothing will start just by dreaming, we haven’t put in enough effort yet
Look up at the sky, your future self is at the end of the rainbow, doing their best
I’ve made my decision, and my decision is to prove I can stick through it to the end
I have to keep trying until you accept it, since you can’t forgive yourself

We’ll get closer after we grow apart (And then)
Grow apart as we get closer (And then)
I think about how we can open up to each other, how I want to be your strength
I’ve been waiting for this moment (I’m so glad, so glad we met)

Fly to the rainbow
Let’s dance so that we can fly on our wishes, and our hearts will be connected
We met, so I’m sure no matter how far apart we are,
We can meet again, someday
I’m sure someday we can meet again

How is it that they go by in the blink of an eye like that?
The seasons aren’t able to come to a halt
Today too (goes by), today (goes by) can only look forward
And it won’t ever come again…

(Go next!)
Over the rainbow
Let’s sing while basking in the light and our hearts will be connected
Let’s make a promise on the vanishing rainbow
I won’t ever forget you
Fly to the rainbow
Let’s dance so that we can fly on our wishes, and our hearts will be connected
I wanted to meet you, even if we were far apart,
We can meet again, someday
I’m sure someday we can meet again
